<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Pieces of Planes</h1>
<p>Whereas the last chapter discussed one-dimensional maps whose graphs are segments of lines, this chapter deals with two-dimensional maps whose graphs are pieces of planes and which thus produce much more interesting displays. This chapter provides the minimum tools for creating attractors that genuinely qualify as art. Armed with only the information contained here, you have such a great variety of available patterns that you hardly need to proceed beyond this chapter. But if you do stop here, you miss some delightful surprises.</p>
<div id="quadratic-maps-in-two-dimensions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Quadratic Maps in Two Dimensions</h2>
<p>In the discussion so far, the maps have involved a single variable X whose value changes with each iteration of the equation. Such maps are said to be onedimensional because the values of X can be thought of as lying along a line, and a line is a one-dimensional object. By plotting each value of X versus a previous value of X, the line can be made to wiggle with considerable complexity; but it always remains a line, and lines are of limited interest and beauty.</p>
<p>The situation is more interesting when you consider iterated maps that involve two variables, X and Y. In such a case, each iterate produces a point in a plane, where X, by convention, represents the horizontal coordinate of the point, and Y represents the vertical coordinate. With successive iteration, the points fill in some portion of the plane. The visually interesting cases, as usual, are the chaotic ones.</p>
<p>Such two-dimensional maps might arise, for example, from an ecological model only slightly more complicated than the logistic equation. A classic example is the predator-prey problem in which X represents the prey and Y the predator. In a simple linear model, the solution is a fixed point (a unique number of both predators and prey) or a limit cycle (both the number of predators and the number of prey oscillate, reaching their maximum values at different times, but eventually repeating). When nonlinear terms are introduced into the model, the population of each species can behave chaotically. You can think of each point that makes up such an attractor as the population of predators and prey in successive years. Since such complexity arises from these very simple models, it’s easy to understand why ecologists might have trouble predicting the fate of biological species!</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known chaotic two-dimensional map is the Hénon map (proposed by the French astronomer <em>Michel Hénon</em> in 1976), whose equations are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X_{n+1}=1+aX_n^2+bY_n
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
Y_{n+1}=X_n
\]</span></p>
<p>The quantities a and b are the control parameters, analogous to R in the logistic equation. Hénon used the values a = -1.4 and b = 0.3. The necessary nonlinearity is provided by the X 2 term in the first equation. The Hénon map is special because the net contraction of a set of initial points covering an area of the XY plane is constant with each iteration. The area occupied by the points is 30% of the area at the previous iteration (from the bYn term). Other values of b can be used, but not all values produce chaotic solutions. Unlike the logistic map, the Hénon map is invertable; there is a unique value for Xn and Yn corresponding to each Xn+1 and Yn+1. You may have seen an alternate form of the Hénon equations in which the factor b appears instead in the second equation and the sign preceding the X2 term is negative. The result of repeated iteration of Equation 3A is shown in Figure 3-1.</p>
<p>3-1: The Henon map EWM?MPMMWMMMM F = 1.20 L = 0.60</p>
<p>The resulting graph is more than a line but less than a surface. What resembles a single line is a pair of lines, each of which is, in turn, another pair of lines, and so forth to however close you look or whatever magnification you choose. This selfsimilarity is a common characteristic of a class of objects that are called fractals.</p>
<p>Fractals are to chaos what geometry is to algebra—the visual expression of the mathematical idea. Approaching an understanding of chaos through such visual means is appealing to those with an aversion to conventional mathematics. The Euclidean geometry we learned in high school originated with the ancient Greeks and was developed more fully by the French mathematician Descartes and others in the 1600s. It deals with simple shapes such as lines, circles, and spheres. Euclidean geometry is now being augmented by fractal geometry, whose father and champion is the contemporary mathematician, Benoit Mandelbrot. Fractals appeared in art, such as in the drawings of the Dutch artist Maurits C. Escher, before they were widely appreciated by mathematicians and scientists.</p>
<p>Some fractals are exactly self-similar, which means that they look the same no matter how much you magnify them. Others, such as most of the ones in this book, only have regions that are self-similar. There is no part of the Hénon map where you can zoom in and find a miniature replica of the entire map. Other fractals are only statistically self-similar, which means that a magnified portion of the object has the same amount of detail as the whole, but it is not an exact replica of it. Nearly all strange attractors are fractals, but not all fractals arise from strange attractors.</p>
<p>The Hénon map produces an object with a fractal dimension that is a fraction intermediate between one and two. The fractal dimension is a useful quantity for characterizing strange attractors. Isolated points have dimension zero, line segments have dimension one, surfaces have dimension two, and solids have dimension three. Strange attractors generally have noninteger dimensions.</p>
<p>Some authors make a distinction between strange attractors, which have non-interger dimension, and chaotic attractors, which exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions.</p>
<p>Since the Hénon map has X 2 as its highest-order term, it is a quadratic map. The most general two-dimensional iterated quadratic map is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X_{n+1}=a_1+a_2X_n+a_3X_n^2+a_4X_nY_n+a_5Y_n+a_6Y_n^2
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
Y_{N+1}=a_7+a_8X_n+a_9X_n^2+a_{10}X_nY_n+a_{11}Y_n+a_{12}Y_n^2
\]</span></p>
<p>The two equations in Equation 3B have 12 coefficients. For the Hénon map, <span class="math inline">\(a_1 = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_3 = -1.4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_5 = 0.3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_8 = 1\)</span>, and the other coefficients are zero. If we use the initial letter E to represent two-dimensional quadratic maps, the code for the Hénon map according to Table 2-1 is EWM?MPM2WM4, where we have introduced the shorthand M2 for MM and M4 for MMMM.</p>
<p>Values of a in the range of -1.2 to 1.2 are sufficient to produce an enormous variety of strange attractors. With increments of 0.1, there are 2512 or about 6 x 1016 different cases, of which approximately 1.6% or about 1015 are chaotic. Viewing them all at a rate of one per second would require over 30 million years! Stated differently, if each one were printed on an 81/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper, the collection would cover nearly the entire land mass of Earth.</p>
<p>Note that not all the cases are strictly distinct. For example, if you replace X
with Y and Y with -X in Equation 3B, you produce an attractor rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the original. When you do this, be sure to change Xn+1 and Yn+1 as well as Xn and Yn. Thus the code EM4CMWJM3? produces a rotated version of the Hénon map. In the same fashion, you can rotate an attractor through 180 degrees by replacing X with -X and Y with -Y and through 270 degrees by replacing X with -Y and Y with X. Perhaps it’s easier just to rotate your computer monitor!</p>
<p>Besides rotations, there are cases that correspond to reflections. When viewed in a mirror, the attractors have left and right reversed, but up and down remain the same. A transformation in which X is replaced with -X accomplishes this. Thus the code for a reflected Hénon map is ECM[MJM2CM4. In addition, the reflections can be rotated. Thus there are at least eight so-called degenerate states for each attractor, corresponding to rotations and reflections. Such symmetries and degeneracies play an important role in science; they often reduce the amount of work we have to do and provide relations between phenomena that initially
appear different.</p>
<p>Additional degenerate cases correspond to scale changes. For example, if you replace X by mX and Y by nY with m = n, the attractor remains the same except it is reduced in size by a factor of m. Some of the coefficients are likely to be outside the allowed range, however. The Hénon map with m = n = 2 can be generated with the code ERM1MPM2WM4. With m not equal to n, the horizontal and vertical dimensions are scaled differently, but since the computer rescales the attractor to fit the screen, the visual result is the same.</p>
<p>These degeneracies show that there are many ways to code a particular attractor. Although this is true, there are so many different possible combinations of coefficients that it is very unlikely that two degenerate cases will be found spontaneously. Thus the examples displayed in this chapter represent but a tiny fraction of the possibilities, and you will be generating many other cases, almost none of which have been seen before.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The Butterfly Effect Revisited</h2>
<p>Two-dimensional chaotic iterated maps also exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions, but the situation is more complicated than for one-dimensional maps. Imagine a collection of initial conditions filling a small circular region of the XY plane.</p>
<p>After one iteration, the points have moved to a new position in the plane, but they now occupy an elongated region called an ellipse. The circle has contracted in one direction and expanded in the other. With each iteration, the ellipse gets longer and narrower, eventually stretching out into a long filament. The orientation of the filament also changes with each iteration, and it wraps up like a ball of taffy.</p>
<p>Thus two-dimensional chaotic maps have not a single Lyapunov exponent but two—a positive one corresponding to the direction of expansion, and a negative one corresponding to the direction of contraction. The signature of chaos is that at least one of the Lyapunov exponents is positive. Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative exponent has to be greater than the positive one so that initial conditions scattered throughout the basin of attraction contract onto an attractor that occupies a negligible portion of the plane. The area of the ellipse continually decreases even as it stretches to an infinite length.</p>
<p>There is a proper way to calculate both of the Lyapunov exponents. For the mathematically inclined, the procedure involves summing the logarithms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the linearized transformation with occasional Gram-Schmidt reorthonormalization. This method is slightly complicated, so we will instead devise a simpler procedure sufficient for determining the largest Lyapunov exponent, which is all we need in order to test for chaos.</p>
<p>Suppose we take two arbitrary but nearby initial conditions. The first few iterations of the map may cause the points to get closer together or farther apart, depending on the initial orientation of the two points. Eventually, the points will come arbitrarily close in the direction of the contraction, but they will continue to separate in the direction of the expansion. Thus if we wait long enough, the rate of separation will be governed only by the largest Lyapunov exponent. Fortunately, this usually takes just a few iterations.</p>
<p>However, because the separation grows exponentially for a chaotic system, the points quickly become too far apart for an accurate estimate of the exponent. This problem can be remedied if, after each iteration, the points are moved back to their original separation along the direction of the new separation. The Lyapunov exponent is then determined by the average of the distance they must be moved for each iteration to maintain a constant small separation. If the two solutions are separated by a distance dnafter the nth iteration, and the separation after the next iteration is <span class="math inline">\(d_{n+1}\)</span>, the Lyapunov exponent is determined from</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L = \Sigma\frac{ log_2(\frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n})}{N}
\]</span>
where the sum is taken over all iterations from n = 0 to n = N-1. After each iteration, the value of one of the iterates is changed to make dn+1 = dn. For the cases here, dn equals 10-6. This procedure also allows us to deal with maps of three and even higher dimensions in which there are more than two Lyapunov exponents.</p>

<div id="the-fractal-dimension" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> The Fractal Dimension</h2>
<pre><code>The previous figures differ considerably in how densely they fill the plane. Some are very thin, others are thick. A good contrast is provided by Figures 3-16 and 3-17. Figure 3-16 resembles a piece of string that has been laid down in a complicated shape on the page, whereas Figure 3-17 looks like a twisted piece of paper with many holes in it. Thus the object in Figure 3-16 has a fractal dimension close to 1, and the object in Figure 3-17 has a fractal dimension closer to 2.
It is possible to be more explicit and to calculate the fractal dimension exactly. Consider two simple cases, one in which successive iterates lie uniformly along a straight line that goes diagonally across the page, and the other in which successive iterates gradually fill the entire plane, as if they were grains of pepper sprinkled on the paper from a great height. The first case has dimension 1, and the second has dimension 2. How would we calculate the dimension, given the X and Y coordinates of an arbitrary collection of such points?
One method is to draw a small circle somewhere on the plane that surrounds at least one of the points. We then draw a second circle with the same center but with twice the radius. Now we count the number of points inside each circle. Let’s say the smaller circle encloses N1 points and the larger circle encloses N2 points. Obviously N2 is greater than or equal to N1 because all the points inside the inner circle are also inside the outer circle.
If the points are widely separated, then N2 equals N1. If the points are part of a straight line, the larger circle on average encloses twice as many points as the smaller circle, but if the points are part of a plane, the larger circle on average encloses four times as many points as the smaller circle, because the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius. Thus for these simple cases the dimension is given by

F = log2 (N2 / N1)                      (Equation 3D)</code></pre>
<p>It is hardly surprising that if you do this operation for the cases shown in the figures, the quantity F is neither 0 nor 1 nor 2 but rather a fraction.
With real data, a number of practical considerations determine the accuracy of the result and the amount of computation required to obtain it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is a circle the best shape, or would a square, rectangle, triangle, or some other shape be better?</li>
<li>How large should the circle be?</li>
<li>Is doubling the size of the circle optimal, or would some other factor be better?</li>
<li>Where should the circles be placed, and how many circles are required to obtain a representative average?</li>
<li>How many points are needed to produce a reliable fractal dimension?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s address each of these questions in turn.
There is nothing special about circles. A rectangle, triangle, or any other two-dimensional figure would suffice, because the area scales as the square of the linear dimension in each case. However, a circle is convenient because it is easy to tell whether a given point is in its interior by comparing the radius of the circle with the distance of the point from its center.
The optimum size of the circle represents a compromise. Ideally, the circles should be invisibly small, because the dimension is defined in the limit of infinite resolution. However, if the circles are too small, they contain too few points to produce a statistically meaningful result, unless an unreasonably large number of iterations is performed. We somewhat arbitrarily use circles with a radius equal to about 2% of the diagonal of the smallest rectangle that contains the attractor.
Similarly, doubling the radius of the circle is arbitrary. Small values degrade the statistics, and large values miss too much of the fine-scale structure. We will use a value of ten, with the smaller circle about 0.6% the size of the attractor and the larger circle about 6% the size of the attractor. Thus in Equation 3D we will use logarithms of base 10 (log10) instead of base 2 (log2).
Ideally, the circles should be placed uniformly or randomly over the plane. However, if we were to do this, most of the circles would be empty, and a very long calculation would be required to obtain an accurate estimate of the dimension. Instead, we center the circles on the data points themselves. In this way the circles tend to enclose many points. However, it represents a different type of average because it weighs more heavily the portions of the attractor where the points are most dense. Technically, what we are calculating is called the correlation dimension, because it involves the number of other points that are correlated with each point in the data set. The correlation dimension is never greater than the fractal dimension, but it tends not to be much smaller either.
The correlation dimension is only one of many ways to define the dimension of an attractor. The various methods differ in how the regions of the attractor are weighed in the average. It is probably the easiest method to implement, and it gives more reliable results than the fractal dimension when the dimension of the attractor is greater than about two. The fractal dimension is also called the capacity dimension, and it is closely related to the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension. Furthermore, the correlation dimension is probably a more meaningful measure of the strangeness of the attractor, because it includes information about its formation as well as its final appearance.
The number of data points required to provide an accurate estimate of the dimension is a question still being debated in the scientific literature. Therefore, we will use a heuristic approach and continually update the dimension estimate with each iteration, giving you an opportunity to decide when it seems to have converged to a unique value. To do this, we must modify the procedure slightly. Rather than count the number of data points within a circle, which would require that the calculation run to conclusion with the coordinates of all the points saved, we use the equivalent method of determining the probability that two randomly chosen points are within a certain distance of one another. To do this, the distance of each new iterate from one of its randomly chosen predecessors is calculated. Now you see why we bothered to save the last 500 iterates! We exclude the most recent 20 points, because the iterates are likely to be abnormally highly correlated with their recent predecessors. Thus, with each iteration, we have only one additional calculation to do in which we compare the distance of the iterate to one of its randomly chosen predecessors and increment N1 and N2, as appropriate. PROG07 shows the changes needed to calculate and display the fractal dimension.</p>

<pre><code>At this point you might want to examine the fractal dimension of the various figures in this book as well as the dimension of those you create with PROG07. One thing you will notice is that the dimension of objects that resemble lines is often less than 1.0. One reason is that the points that make up the line are seldom uniformly distributed along its length. Remember that the correlation dimension is usually smaller than the fractal dimension. They are equal if the points are uniformly distributed over the attractor. The correlation dimension of a line consisting of a uniform distribution of points along its length would be exactly 1.0.
Also note that the dimension of most attractors varies considerably from one part of the attractor to another. Figure 3-11 is a good example of one in which parts of the attractor resemble thin lines and other parts resemble filled-in planes. It obviously is simplistic to characterize such an object by a single average dimension.
The dimension also depends on scale. It is properly defined in the limit where one zooms in very tightly on the attractor to observe its finest detail. However, a calculation in this limit would take forever because an infinite number of iterations would be required to collect enough points to reveal the detail. Figure 3-13 is an example of an attractor that is nearly one-dimensional on a large scale but closer to two-dimensional on a fine scale. Our calculation provides what might be called a visual dimension because it is taken on a scale close to what the eye can visually resolve. In any case, you should not ascribe undue significance to the calculated dimension.
Also note that we are using the word “dimension” to mean several different things. The maps that we are looking at are two-dimensional because they have two variables, X and Y. However, the attractor has a smaller dimension. We say the attractor is embedded in a two-dimensional space or that the embedding dimension is 2. A point or a line can be embedded in a plane, but a ball cannot.
An attractor usually fills a negligible portion of the space in which it is embedded. That’s why it’s called an attractor! Points initially distributed throughout the embedding space are drawn to the attractor after a number of iterations, and the remaining space is left empty. Thus the area of an attractor embedded in a two-dimensional space is zero, and the volume of an attractor embedded in a three-dimensional space is zero, and so forth.
It is also interesting that the fractal dimension and the Lyapunov exponents are not entirely independent. It has been conjectured that the fractal dimension is related to the two Lyapunov exponents by

F = 1 - L1 / L2                     (Equation 3E)</code></pre>
<p>where L1 is the more positive of the two exponents and is the one we denote by L in the figures. If both Lyapunov exponents are known, Equation 3E can be used to define a dimension of the attractor, called the Lyapunov dimension. The Lyapunov dimension is also called the Kaplan-Yorke dimension after the scientists who proposed an extension of Equation 3E to higher dimensions.
This relation is reasonable because, if the two exponents are equal but of opposite signs (L2 = - L1), the contraction in one direction is just offset by expansion in the other. A set of initial conditions spread out over a two-dimensional region thus maintains its area upon successive iteration. Such a mapping is said to be area-preserving, symplectic, or Hamiltonian, after the 19th-century Irish astronomer, William Rowan Hamilton. On the other hand, if the contraction is very rapid (L2 is large and negative), the initial conditions quickly collapse to a very elongated ellipse whose dimension is close to 1. Such a contraction is sometimes called filamentation.
Armed with information about the fractal dimension, you can program the computer to be even more selective. For example, the visually appealing attractors tend to have fractal dimensions slightly greater than 1, and thus you could reject those with smaller dimensions or those with dimensions close to 2. We return to this intriguing possibility in Chapter 8.</p>

<pre><code>With one-dimensional maps, the attractors became more interesting when we considered terms higher than quadratic. It is straightforward to do the same with two-dimensional maps. For example, the most general equations for two-dimensional cubic maps are

Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Xn2 + a4Xn3 + a5Xn2Yn 
+ a6XnYn  + a7XnYn2 + a8Yn + a9Yn2 + a10Yn3
Yn+1 = a11 + a12Xn + a13Xn2 + a14Xn3 + a15Xn2Yn 
+ a16XnYn + a17XnYn2 + a18Yn + a19Yn2 + a20Yn3  (Equation 3F)

Note that there are 20 coefficients, which vastly increases the number of possible cases. The fourth-order case would have 30 coefficients, and the fifth-order case would have 42 coefficients. If you prefer an equation, a two-dimensional map of order O has (O + 1)(O + 2) coefficients. We will code the cubic, quartic, and quintic cases with the letters F, G, and H, respectively.

<pre><code>Perhaps this is a good point to pause and reiterate in what sense these objects are attractors. If you choose initial values of X and Y somewhere near the attractor, within its basin of attraction, and substitute these values into the equations that describe the attractor, the new values of X and Y represent a point in the plane that is closer to the attractor. After a number of iterations, the point works its way to the attractor, and thereafter it moves around on the attractor in some complicated manner, eventually visiting every part of the attractor. The next position can always be simply and accurately predicted from the current position, but the small, inevitable uncertainty in position continually increases so that a long-term prediction is impossible, except to say that the point is somewhere on the attractor. You can think of the attractor as the set of all possible long-term solutions of the equations that produced it.
Besides the error in knowing perfectly the initial conditions, there are also computer round-off errors at each iteration. Given the extreme sensitivity to small errors, you may wonder whether any computer is capable of calculating correctly such a chaotic process. It is true that if the same chaotic equations are iterated on two computers using different precision or round-off methods, the sequence of iterates is almost certainly completely different after a few dozen iterations. However, the appearance of the attractor is probably the same. In such a case, we say that the solution is structurally stable or robust. Furthermore, according to the shadowing lemma, an appropriate small change in initial conditions produces a chaotic sequence that follows arbitrarily close to the computed one.
Since computers always round the results of calculations to a finite number of digits (or more precisely, bits), a limited number of values is allowed. Thus successive iteration of a map always eventually repeats a previously obtained value, whereupon the solution reproduces exactly the same sequence of states as it did before. Strictly speaking, every such solution is periodic, and true chaos cannot be observed with a computer. However, with double-precision floating-point variables, which are normally 64 bits, there are 264 or about 1019 possible values. It can be shown that an average periodicity occurs after about the square root of this number of iterations, which is about 3 x 109. Until the number of iterations approaches this value, there is little cause to worry. For maps higher than one dimension, this problem is even less serious because all the variables have to reach a previously existing state at the same time.
It is also interesting to realize that infinitely many periodic solutions are embedded in each attractor. These solutions are called periodic orbits. From wherever you start on the attractor, you eventually return to a point arbitrarily close to the starting point. This result is called the Poincaré recurrence theorem, after Jules-Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician who a hundred years ago portended the modern era of chaos. Thus by making only a small change in the starting point, it is possible, in principle, to return exactly to the starting point, which implies a periodic orbit with a period equal to the number of iterations required to return. Most of these orbits have very large periods, however.
Every point on the attractor is arbitrarily close to such a periodic orbit, but the chance that a randomly chosen point on the attractor lies on such an orbit is infinitesimal. We say that the periodic orbits are dense on the attractor. These orbits, though infinite in number, constitute a Cantor set of measure zero. The periodic orbits are unstable in the sense that if you get just slightly off the orbit, you continue to get farther away with each iteration.
The strange attractors exhibited in this book are examples of orbital fractals. They should be distinguished from escape-time fractals, which show the basin of attraction and typically display with color the number of iterations required for points outside the basin to escape beyond some predefined region. The Mandelbrot and Julia sets are perhaps the best-known escape-time fractals. Escape-time fractals require much longer computing times to develop but provide dazzling displays with exotic fine-scale structures.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Strange Attractor Planets</h2>
<pre><code>The previous figures have obvious beauty, but they generally lack symmetry. Nature mixes symmetry with disorder, and our sense of beauty has developed accordingly. The Earth viewed from outer space is beautiful in part because the irregular features of the clouds and continents are superimposed on a nearly perfect sphere.
There are many ways to do the same with our attractors. Suppose, for example, X and Y are not the horizontal and vertical positions in a plane but rather the longitude and latitude on the surface of the Earth. The result is an object that might resemble a strange planet with swirling clouds, oceans, canals, craters, and other features.
Note that mapping a plane onto a sphere is a nonlinear transformation. You can’t wrap a piece of paper around a globe without a large nonuniform stretching. That’s why Greenland looks larger than South America on most flat maps. When a sphere is projected onto a flat computer screen or onto the page of a book, it is stretched so as to magnify the central portion of the attractor and compress the edges.
If  is the longitude (measured from zero at the right edge) and  is the latitude (measured from zero at the top), the X and Y coordinates of the projection of a sphere onto the screen are given by

Xp = cos q sin f
Yp = cos f                      (Equation 3G)

We get  from X by a scaling that keeps  in the range of  to  radians (180 degrees), because there is no need to plot points that lie on the back side of the planet. Similarly, we get  from Y by a scaling that keeps  in the range of  (at the North Pole) to  radians (at the South Pole). The program modifications required to accomplish this transformation are given in PROG09. This program allows you to toggle back and forth between the two types of projection by pressing the P key.</code></pre>

<pre><code>If you are using PowerBASIC or its predecessor, Turbo BASIC, and VGA graphics, you will notice a slight incompatibility with the CIRCLE command that causes the size of the circle that surrounds the attractor to vary from case to case. In these dialects of BASIC, the radius of the circle in SCREEN modes 11 and 12 is specified in units of the screen height rather than its width. If you encounter this problem, try replacing .36 * (XH - XL) in line 3320 with .5 * (YH - YL).
Planes and spheres are not the only two-dimensional surfaces onto which attractors can be projected. A cylinder is another possibility. The cylinder can be oriented with its axis either horizontal or vertical or tilted at some arbitrary angle. A torus is another possibility. You may be able to think of other more exotic surfaces onto which the attractors can be projected.</code></pre>

<pre><code>It is interesting that all the one-dimensional maps described in the previous chapter are included in the two-dimensional cases. One needs only to set the coefficients of the Y equation to zero. For example, a two-dimensional map equivalent to the logistic equation is given by the code EMu%M9. However, because Y doesn’t change with successive iterations, a graph of Y versus X is simply a straight, horizontal line.
To display the logistic parabola, we need to replace X with the next iterate of X and Y with the second next iterate of X. Two successive iterations of a quadratic map requires a fourth-order equation. A code that accomplishes this is GMu%M13NHUIM10.
There are other examples of two-dimensional maps that are really one-dimensional maps in disguise. Suppose Xn+1 depends only on Yn and Yn+1 depends only on Xn. Then Xn+2 depends only on Xn, and we have a one-dimensional map for X in which Y is merely an intermediate value of X. The most general fifth-order polynomial example of such a case is

Xn+1 = a1 + a17Yn + a18Yn2 + a19Yn3 + a20Yn4 + a21Yn5
Yn+1 = a22 + a23Xn + a24Xn2 + a25Xn3 + a26Xn4 + a27Xn5      (Equation 3H)</code></pre>
<p>This case can be achieved by setting the remaining 30 coefficients to zero in PROG09 by adding the following line after line 2730:</p>

<p>The result is to produce a 25th-order, one-dimensional polynomial map displayed in two dimensions.
Figures 3-58 through 3-61 show sample attractors obtained in this way. Notice that they fill in rectangular regions resembling a plaid tartan, in sharp contrast to all the previous cases. These attractors are especially appropriate for projecting onto spheres because the features line up east-west along parallels and north-south along meridians.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Strange Attractors that Don’t</h2>
<pre><code>From the foregoing discussion, you might conclude that all chaotic equations produce strange attractors. Such is not the case. Under certain conditions, the successive iterates of an equation wanders chaotically throughout a region of the plane. There is no basin of attraction, and initial conditions near but outside the chaotic region are not drawn to the region but rather lie on closed curves. Although the chaotic region is not a strange attractor, it may have considerable beauty.
For a chaotic solution not to attract, the area occupied by a cluster of nearby initial conditions must remain the same with successive iterations. The cluster generally contracts in one direction and expands in the other, but the contraction and expansion just cancel, producing a long, thin filament of constant area. A characteristic of such a case is that the two Lyapunov exponents are equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. Such a system is area-preserving. An important class of area-preserving systems are Hamiltonian systems with their corresponding symplectic maps.
You might think that Hamiltonian systems are relatively rare in nature, because they require a special condition. However, there are many important examples of Hamiltonian chaos. They arise because there are quantities in nature such as energy and angular momentum that, in the absence of friction, remain accurately constant no matter how complicated the behavior of the system. We say these quantities are conserved or that they are constants of the motion. The motion of a planet orbiting a binary-star system or the motion of an electron near the null in a magnetic field exhibits Hamiltonian chaos. A more familiar example is the filamentation of milk when it is stirred into coffee, in which case the volume of the milk is conserved because liquids are nearly incompressible.
With equations such as those we have been using with randomly chosen coefficients, the chance of inadvertently finding an area-preserving solution is essentially zero. However, by placing appropriate conditions on the coefficients, we can guarantee such solutions. The following is an example of an area-preserving, two-dimensional polynomial map:

Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Xn2 + a4Xn3 + a5Xn4 + a6Xn5 ± Yn
Yn+1 = a22 ± Xn                         (Equation 3I)

This map is fifth order to provide seven arbitrary coefficients that ensure a large number of solutions. The coefficient labels are consistent with the general two-dimensional fifth-order map, in which 33 of the coefficients have been set to zero. The two terms preceded with ± have coefficients (a17 and a23) of either +1 or -1, and this feature guarantees an area-preserving solution. If the signs are the same (both plus or both minus), chaotic solutions are not found. Hamiltonian chaos can occur when the signs are opposite. The negative product of these two coefficients is the Jacobian of the map (J = -a17a23). The Jacobian is a measure of the net contraction, and it must equal 1.0 for a Hamiltonian system.
Hamiltonian cases can be produced by adding the following lines to PROG09 after line 2730:</code></pre>
<p>2735 IF I% &gt; O% + 1 AND I% &lt;&gt; M% / 2 + 1 THEN MID<span class="math inline">\((CODE\)</span>, I% + 1, 1) = “M”

<pre><code>Sample chaotic symplectic maps are shown in Figures 3-64 through 3-71. Most of the cases resemble chains of islands in which each island contains a fixed point surrounded by closed contours that are not shown. These cases were produced using initial values of X = Y = 0.05. Other initial conditions would produce completely different pictures because there is no attractor.</code></pre>

These cases have a different look from non-symplectic strange attractors. The difference is even more pronounced if you watch while they develop on the computer screen. Whereas the regions of a strange attractor tend to be visited uniformly and apparently randomly, the symplectic maps develop much more slowly. The points often wander over a small region for tens of thousands of iterations, and then they suddenly begin to fill in a new distinct region that has never been visited before. Consequently, many more iterations are required to determine the stability and chaotic nature of the solution. You need to be patient while the computer calculates.</p>
<pre><code>The different time behavior of these cases raises an important issue. When you view any of the figures in this book, you are seeing a static object. However, it was produced by a dynamic process. Information about the sequence in which the points accumulated has been lost. This additional information is recovered when you watch the attractors develop on your computer screen. Most of the attractors fill in uniformly. Their contrast gets progressively greater, much like a photographic print being developed.
However, the symplectic maps develop more slowly and in stages. If your computer has a color monitor, you might try exhibiting this sequence by plotting the points in color and changing the color every few thousand iterations. Some examples using this technique are shown in Section 7.5. If you try this for the non-symplectic attractors, the colors overlap and merge into a uniform gray, or you just see the most recent color. For the symplectic maps, beautiful color patterns can be produced. Otherwise, continue on to the next chapter, where various color techniques are discussed.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> A New Dimension in Sound</h2>
<pre><code>With one-dimensional maps, we tried to make music by letting successive iterates control the pitch of the musical notes, all of which were of the same duration. The same procedure can be used with two-dimensional maps. However, we have a second variable at our disposal, so let’s use it to control the duration of each note. With actual music, it turns out that there are many more notes of short duration than of long duration. There are roughly twice as many half notes as whole notes, and twice as many quarter notes as half notes, and so forth. This remarkable result seems to hold for all types of music from different composers and cultures. It is evidence of hidden determinism in music.
The program modification PROG10 uses the X value to control the pitch and the Y value to control the duration of the notes. For convenience, we assume that the longest note is a whole note and the shortest note is a sixteenth note. Dotted notes and rests are not allowed.
PROG10 also adds to the program a menu screen that reminds you of the S command, which toggles the sound on and off, and the P command, which toggles the projection between planar and spherical. We also introduce an A command to initiate the search for attractors, a D command to toggle between one-dimensional and two-dimensional maps, an I command to let you input the code of an attractor that you know, and an X command to exit the program. Pressing any other key displays the menu screen.</code></pre>

After you have generated some music of your own, you may want to try some of the cases in Table 3-1 using the I command to input them to the program. These cases have been selected for their musical quality and are limited to quadratic maps to simplify typing their codes.

<pre><code>After listening to the enormous variety of musical sequences that can be generated by this technique, you might wonder whether your favorite musical composition could be compressed into a short code and generated using iterated maps. After all, even the simple cases in Table 3-1 are chosen from among about 6 x 1016 different codes, and each code corresponds to a different piece of music.
However, a typical musical piece might have hundreds or thousands of notes, each of which can represent dozens of pitches and many durations. Thus we can be fairly confident using the principles of information theory that such extreme compression is unlikely, unless music has considerably more structure than is apparent. However, if you only want to generate a short tune with a few notes, there might well be a way to do so using this technique. If you are mathematically inclined, take it as a challenge to find a way to do this.
The generation of computer music using chaotic iterated maps is a promising technique still in its infancy. You may want to incorporate more sophisticated musical rules into the program to generate music that is much more pleasing than what results from this simple procedure. Furthermore, an interesting project would be to turn the process around and see if music written by humans resembles a strange attractor, and if so, to measure its fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent. Perhaps music of different types or by different composers would have different values of these quantities.</code></pre>

<p>#Attractors of Depth
A two-dimensional world is a mere shadow of reality. The techniques described in the previous chapters are easily extended to produce attractors embedded in the three-dimensional space in which we live. The challenge is in finding ways to exhibit and visualize such three-dimensional objects within the limitations of the computer screen and printed page. This chapter emphasizes new visualization techniques and provides many new examples of strange attractors that have depth as well as width and height.</p>
</div>
<div id="projections" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Projections</h2>
<pre><code>The procedure for seeking attractors in three dimensions (which we might whimsically call strange attractors of the third kind) is just like the two-dimensional case, except that we introduce a third variable Z to accompany X and Y. You can think of Z as representing the position in a direction out of the screen or page on which the attractor is displayed. We assume the direction of positive Z is in front of the page and the direction of negative Z is behind the page, as is customary for a conventional right-handed coordinate system. The term right-handed comes from the convention that if you point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the X-axis and curl them so that they point along the Y-axis, your thumb points in the Z direction. This choice is purely arbitrary but widely accepted.
The simplest system of equations that produces strange attractors embedded in a three-dimensional space is a set of coupled quadratic equations, the most general form of which is given by

Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Xn2 + a4XnYn + a5XnZn + a6Yn 
    + a7Yn2 + a8YnZn + a9Zn + a10Zn2
Yn+1 = a11 + a12Xn + a13Xn2 + a14XnYn + a15XnZn + a16Yn
    + a17Yn2 + a18YnZn + a19Zn + a20Zn2 
Zn+1 = a21 + a22Xn + a23Xn2 + a24XnYn + a25XnZn + a26Yn
    + a27Yn2 + a28YnZn + a29Zn + a30Zn2             (Equation 4A)

These equations have 30 coefficients, which allow an enormous variety of attractors. The extension to equations with orders higher than two is straightforward. Three-dimensional cubic equations have 60 coefficients, quartic equations have 105 coefficients, and quintic equations have 168 coefficients. The number of coefficients for order O is given by (O + 1)(O + 2)(O + 3) / 2. We will code the second-order through fifth-order systems in three dimensions with the initial letters I, J, K, and L, respectively.
Note that 168 coefficients allows 25168 or about 10234 combinations. This is a truly astronomical number. Even if only a small fraction of them correspond to distinct strange attractors, their number enormously exceeds the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons in the entire universe—a mere 1079. Thus the number of fifth-order three-dimensional strange attractors is essentially infinite. You can have a large collection of your own, none of which are likely to be reproduced by anyone else unless you give them the code you used to produce them. The code is like a combination lock with 168 settings that all must be entered correctly and in the proper order.
Now we must confront the issue of how best to display an object composed of points in a three-dimensional space. Such problems are in the domain of a new specialty called visualization, which we may define as the use of computer imagery to gain insight into complex phenomena. The need for improved visualization techniques has emerged from the rapidly growing use of computers as the primary tool for scientific calculation and modeling. As computers become more powerful, it is increasingly important to devise methods of dealing with large quantities of data. The eye and brain are very efficient at discerning visual patterns, and these patterns permit an intuitive understanding of complicated processes in a way that equations often cannot. Scientists have recently developed impressive visualization techniques, simple versions of which are presented here.
The simplest method is to ignore one of the coordinates and to plot the points in the remaining two dimensions. This method is equivalent to looking at the shadow cast by an object when illuminated from directly above by a point-source of light a large distance away. If the light source is on the Z-axis, we say the attractor is projected onto the XY plane. The screen used in conjunction with a slide projector is such a plane. Of course, considerable information about the attractor is lost in such a projection, but the method is a convenient starting point, and it is simple to program.
PROG11 provides the changes that must be made in PROG10 to extend the attractor search to three dimensions with order up to five. Since the search slows down considerably in three dimensions with such a large number of coefficients, especially if you don’t have a compiled version of BASIC and a fast computer, the program saves, for each case found, the code, fractal dimension, and Lyapunov exponent in a disk file with the name SA.DIC (Strange Attractor DICtionary). This feature allows you to run the program unattended and to collect the attractors it finds. We will later modify the program to let you examine the cases that you collect.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Some examples of the attractors produced by PROG11 are shown in Figures 4-1 through 4-16. Note that the fractal dimension shown for each case is the dimension of the actual attractor and not the dimension of its projection. Thus the fractal dimension can be as large as 3 even though the projection has dimension of at most 2. The projection of a point (zero dimensions) onto a surface is a point, the projection of a line (one dimension) is a line, the projection of a surface (two dimensions) is a surface, but the projection of a solid (three dimensions) onto a surface is only a surface (two dimensions).</code></pre>

<pre><code>On the whole, attractors in three dimensions projected onto a plane are not particularly different or better than the two-dimensional examples of the previous chapter. Ones with high fractal dimensions (near and above 2) tend to be uninteresting when projected onto two dimensions because they are too filled-in. Note also that all the two-dimensional cases are included as special cases of the three-dimensional ones and that they can be recovered by setting the appropriate coefficients to zero. For example, the Hénon map can be reproduced in three dimensions using the code IWM?M2PM5WM18. You may want to try entering this case into the program using the I command. Be sure to count the number of Ms very carefully and to use capital letters.
The attractors displayed in the previous figures are projected onto the XY plane. They could equally well be projected onto the YZ or ZX plane. With a bit more effort it would be possible to project them onto a plane inclined at an arbitrary angle. Attractors are most visually appealing when viewed from a particular direction. The formulas that transform a point with coordinates (X, Y, Z) into a two-dimensional projection (Xp, Yp) with viewing angles (, ) in spherical coordinates are

Xp = - X sin q + Y cos q
Yp = - X sin q cos f - Y sin q cos f + Z sin f      (Equation 4B)</code></pre>
<p>With a sufficiently powerful computer, you could rotate the attractor to produce an animated display. You may want to experiment with these ideas.
The program can be modified in a number of ways to change the orientation of the projection. The simplest (though not very practical) way is just to wait until the search turns up the same attractor viewed from a different angle. Note in Equation 4A, for example, that if you interchange the coefficients in an appropriate way, the result is to replace X with Y, Y with Z, and Z with X. If the attractor code were IABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^, the code IKPQRNSTOLMUZ[]^YVWAFGHDIJEBC would produce a projection of the same attractor onto the YZ plane, and the code IU]^Y1/2 (Equation 5A)</p>
<pre><code>Because of the minus sign in Equation 5A, time is considered to be an imaginary dimension; an imaginary number is one whose square is negative. Note, however, that the word “imaginary” does not mean it is any less real than the other dimensions, only that its square combines with the others through subtraction rather than addition. If you are unfamiliar with imaginary numbers, don’t be put off by the name. They aren’t really imaginary; they are just the other part of certain quantities that require a pair of numbers rather than a single number to specify them.
The minus sign also means that proper length, unlike ordinary length, may be imaginary. If the proper length is imaginary, we say the events are separated in a timelike, as opposed to a spacelike, manner. Timelike events can be causally related (one event can influence the other), but spacelike events cannot, because information about one would have to travel faster than the speed of light to reach the other, which is impossible. Events separated in a timelike manner are more conveniently characterized by a proper time:

Proper time = [DT2 - DX2/c2 - DY2/c2 - DZ2/c2]1/2   (Equation 5B)</code></pre>
<p>In this case, time is real, but space is imaginary. Proper length is the length of an object as measured by an observer moving with the same velocity as the object, and proper time is the time measured by a clock moving with the same velocity as the observer.
Quantities such as proper length and proper time on which all observers agree, independent of their motion, are called invariants. The speed of light itself is an invariant. There are many others, and they all involve four components that combine by the Pythagorean theorem.
Thus the theory of relativity ties space and time together in a very fundamental way. One person’s space is another person’s time. Since space and time can be traded back and forth, there is no reason to call time the fourth dimension any more than we call width the second dimension. It is better just to say that space-time is four-dimensional, with each dimension on an equal footing. The apparent asymmetry between space and time comes from the large value of c (3 x 108 meters per second, or about a billion miles per hour) and the fact that time moves in only one direction (past to future). It is also important to understand that, although special relativity is called a “theory,” it has been extensively verified to high accuracy by many experiments, most of which involve particle accelerators.
The foregoing discussion explains why it might be useful to consider four-dimensional space and four-dimensional objects, but it is probably fruitless to waste too much time trying to visualize them. However, we can describe them mathematically as extensions of familiar objects in lower dimensions.
For example, a hypercube is the four-dimensional extension of the three-dimensional cube and the two-dimensional square. It has 16 corners, 32 edges, 24 faces, and contains 8 cubes. Its hypervolume is the fourth power of the length of each edge, just as the volume of a cube is the cube of the length of an edge and the area of a square is the square of the length of an edge.
A hypersphere consists of all points at a given distance from its center in four-dimensional space. Its hypersurface is three-dimensional and consists of an infinite family of spheres, just as the surface of an ordinary sphere is two-dimensional and consists of an infinite family of circles. We have reason to believe that our Universe might be a hypersurface of a very large hypersphere, in which case we could see ourselves if we peered far enough into space, except for the fact that we are also looking backward to a time before Earth existed. We would also need an incredibly powerful telescope to see Earth in this way. Thus our perception that space is three-dimensional could be analogous to the ancient view that Earth was flat, a consequence of experience limited to a small portion of its surface.</p>

<pre><code>The previous section was intended to motivate your consideration of strange attractors embedded in four-dimensional space, but most of the discussion is not essential to what follows. We will now describe the computer program necessary to produce attractors in four dimensions and then develop methods to visualize them.
The mathematical generalization from three to four dimensions is straightforward. Whereas before we had three variables—X, Y, and Z—we now have a fourth. Having used up the three letters at the end of the alphabet, we must back up and use W for the fourth dimension, but remember that all the dimensions are on an equal footing. We use the first letters M, N, O, and P to code 4-D attractors of second through fifth orders, respectively. The number of coefficients for these cases is 60, 140, 280, and 504, respectively. The number of coefficients for order O is (O + 1)(O + 2)(O + 3)(O + 4) / 6. The number of four-dimensional fifth-order codes is 25504, a number too large to compare to anything meaningful; it might as well be infinite.
The program modifications required to add a fourth dimension are shown in PROG18. </code></pre>

If you run PROG18 under certain old versions of BASIC, such as BASICA and GW-BASIC, you are likely to get an error in line 2710 when the program attempts to construct a code for the fourth-order and fifth-order maps as a result of the string-length limit of 255 characters. In such a case, you may need to restrict the search to second and third orders by setting OMAX% = 3 in line 1060. Alternatively, it’s not difficult to modify the program to store the code in a pair of strings or to replace the string with a one-dimensional array of integers containing the numeric equivalents of each character in the string, perhaps with a terminating zero to signify the end of the string. For example, after dimensioning CODE%(504) in line 1020, line 2710 would become</p>
<p>2710 CODE%(I%) = 65 + INT(25 * RAN)</p>
<p>and line 2740 would become</p>
<p>2740 A(I%) = (CODE%(I%) - 77) / 10</p>
<pre><code>Also notice that the search for attractors is painfully slow unless you have a very fast computer and a good compiler. Refer back to Table 2-2, which lists some options for increasing the speed. The search can be made faster by limiting it to second order by setting OMAX% = 2 in line 1060.
We have another trick we can use to increase dramatically the rate at which four-dimensional strange attractors are found without sacrificing variety. It turns out that most of these attractors have their constant terms near zero. The reason presumably has to do with the fact that the origin (X = Y = Z = W = 0) is then a fixed point, and the initial condition is chosen near the origin (X0 = Y0 = Z0 = W0 = 0.05). If the fixed point is unstable, then we have one of the conditions necessary for chaos. It is easy to accomplish this by adding after line 2730 a statement such as </code></pre>
<p>2735 IF I% MOD M% / D% = 1 THEN MID<span class="math inline">\((CODE\)</span>, I% + 1, 1) = “M”</p>
<p>This increases the rate of finding attractors by about a factor of 50. Many of the attractors illustrated in this chapter were produced in this way. This change also increases the rate for lower-dimensional maps, but by a much smaller factor. This improvement suggests that there is yet room to optimize the search routine by a more intelligent choice of the values of the other coefficients.
Note that PROG18 does not attempt to display the fourth dimension but projects it onto the other three, for which all the visualization techniques of the last chapter are available. Don’t waste too much time trying to understand what it means to project a four-dimensional object onto a three-dimensional space. It is just a generalization of projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface. In the program, it simply involves plotting X, Y, and Z and ignoring the variable W.
Some examples of four-dimensional attractors projected onto the two-dimensional XY plane are shown in Figures 5-1 through 5-20. They don’t look particularly different from those obtained by projecting three-dimensional attractors onto the plane or, indeed, by just plotting two-dimensional attractors directly. Note that most of these attractors have fractal dimensions less than or about 2.0, so perhaps it is not too surprising that their projections resemble those produced by equations of lower dimension. It is rare to find attractors with fractal dimensions greater than 3.0 produced by four-dimensional polynomial maps, as will be shown in Section 8.1.</p>

<pre><code>You might be interested in the challenge of producing attractors embedded in dimensions higher than four. In five dimensions, you need to define a new variable, say V, and modify the program as was done for four dimensions in PROG18. The program has been written to make it relatively easy to extend it to five or even higher dimensions. Be forewarned that the calculation will be very slow. You will almost certainly want to set the coefficients of the constant terms to zero and probably restrict your search to quadratic maps. The number of fifth-dimension polynomial coefficients for order O is (O + 1)(O + 2)(O + 3)(O + 4)(O + 5) / 24. With O = 5, the number is 1260.
The simplest display technique is to project the fifth dimension onto the other four. This is what the program does automatically if you don’t do anything special. Several combinations of techniques, which we have already developed, are capable of displaying five dimensions. You might try combining shadows, bands, and color, for example. Table 5-2 lists the seven possible combinations of five-dimensional display techniques that don’t lead to visual contradictions.</code></pre>

<pre><code>For a heroic exercise in programming, visualization, and patience, you can try to extend the calculation to six dimensions. A six-dimensional, fifth-order system of polynomials has 2772 coefficients. There are only two appropriate combinations of display techniques suitable for six dimensions: shadow-bands-color-slices and bands-color-stereo-slices. If you decide to try seven dimensions, you must invent a new display technique.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.13</span> Writing on the Wall</h2>
<pre><code>Since four-dimensional attractors have the greatest complexity and variety of all the cases described in this book, they offer the greatest potential as display art. For such purposes, you will probably want to print them on a large sheet of paper. With an appropriate printer or plotter, any of the visualization techniques previously described can be used to produce such large prints.
An alternate technique that has proved very successful is an extension of the character-based method described in Section 4.5. In this technique, the third dimension is coded as an ASCII character with a density related to the Z value, and the fourth dimension is coded in color. Color pen and pencil plotters and ink-jet plotters, as well as more expensive but high-quality electrostatic and thermal plotters, normally used for engineering and architectural drawings, can print text on sheets up to 36 inches wide. Ink-jet plotters are growing in popularity over the more traditional pen plotters because they are faster and quieter and don’t require special paper. They can also print gray scales. With care, you can piece together smaller segments printed by more conventional means.
When the attractors are reduced to sequences of text, resolutions of 640 by 480 (VGA) or 800 by 600 (Super VGA) produce large figures whose individual characters can be read when examined closely but that blend into continuous contours when viewed from a distance. Artists often use this technique in which the viewer is provided with a different visual experience on different scales. You should use the largest and boldest characters available to maximize the contrast, provided they remain readable. There should be little or no space between rows and columns of characters. With a pen plotter, the pen size can be chosen for the best compromise of contrast and readability. A pen that makes a line width of 0.35 mm (fine) is a reasonable choice.
Inks are available in only a limited number of colors, and pen plotters are usually capable of accommodating only a small number of pens. The pens can be sequenced to place compatible colors next to one another. With eight pens and commonly available inks, a good sequence is magenta, red, orange (or yellow), brown, black, green, turquoise, and blue. The closest color sequence for viewing on the computer screen from Table 4-1 is 13, 12, 4 (or 14), 6, 8, 2, 3, and 9, with a white (15) background. With upwards of 20 characters producing different color intensities, the limitation of eight colors of ink is not a serious one. With eight colors and ASCII codes from 32 to 255, you can have 28 different intensities for each color. The inks can be mixed to produce different shades of the colors. Pencils are less expensive and don’t clog or dry out as pens often do, but pencil plots have a tendency to smudge. Ink, of course, also smudges until it is thoroughly dry. Plotters are relatively slow, and attractors produced by this method typically require a few hours to a full day to produce.
Paper commonly used for engineering drawings comes in at least five standard sizes—A (8 1/2 by 11 inches), B (12 by 18 inches), C (18 by 24 inches), D (24 by 36 inches), and E (36 by 48 inches). English sizes and architectural sizes are slightly different, and thus a sheet may vary somewhat from these dimensions. Also, 36-inch-wide paper is available on long rolls.
Common paper types are tracing bond, which is the most economical, vellum, which is smooth and translucent, and polyester film, which is highly translucent, dimensionally stable, and relatively expensive. The translucent papers offer the interesting possibility of backing the print with a monochrome or color copy of itself to enhance the contrast or to produce a shadow effect if the two are displaced slightly. Other interesting effects can be achieved by backing one translucent attractor with a print of another or by back-lighting the print. Some papers stretch slightly and thus have a tendency to wrinkle. Paper with significant acid content should be avoided because it turns yellow and becomes brittle with age.
Some of the most artistic examples of strange attractors have been produced by these techniques, but they cannot be adequately illustrated in this book. No computer program is offered, since it is so dependent on your hardware. You will want to experiment to find the technique that works best for you and that makes the most effective use of your printer or plotter.</code></pre>

<div id="murals-and-movies" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.14</span> Murals and Movies</h2>
<pre><code>The technique of making large-scale attractors for display can be carried to its logical extreme by making a mural. Special techniques using some type of stencil are required to transform the computer output to paint on the wall. Silk screen is useful for transferring the image to fabrics. Fractal tee-shirts employing this technique have recently become popular.
To produce a mural, you need to start with a large number of plots, each showing a small section of the attractor. A property of fractals is that they have detail on all scales, and thus a large mural should look interesting when viewed either from a distance or close up.
You might also photograph the computer screen or a high-quality print and produce slides that can be projected onto a large surface or screen with a slide projector. Equipment is available commercially for producing slides directly from digital computer output. A sequence of such slides makes a very compelling presentation or visual accompaniment to a lecture or musical production.
The color slices shown in Plate 22 suggest the possibility of making color movies by extending the technique to a very large number of slices and using each one as a frame of a movie. The effect is to cause the attractor to emerge at a point in an empty field and to grow slowly, bending and wiggling until fully developed, and then to disappear slowly into a different point. If the technology for doing this is not available to you, try printing a large number of attractor slices on small cards and fanning through them to produce a semblance of animation. This technique, using the attractors described in Section 7.6, was used to produce the animation in the upper-right corner of the odd pages of this book.
If the idea of making strange-attractor movies appeals to you, another technique is to take one of your favorite attractors and slowly change one or more of the coefficients in successive frames of the movie. A good way to start is to multiply all the coefficients by a factor that varies from slightly less than 1.0 to slightly greater than 1.0. You must determine the range over which the coefficients can be changed without the solutions becoming unbounded or nonchaotic. The ends of this range then become the beginning and end of the movie.
Sometimes the attractor slowly and continuously alters its shape. The changes can involve bifurcations, such as the period-doubling sequence in the logistic equation described in Chapter 1. Such bifurcations are called subtle. At other times, the attractor and its basin abruptly disappear at a critical value of the control parameter. Such discontinuous bifurcations are called catastrophes.
If the control parameter is changed in the opposite direction, the result may be different from simply running the movie backward. This is an example of hysteresis, which is a form of memory in a dynamical system. It serves to limit the occurrence of catastrophes. The thermostat that controls your heat probably uses hysteresis to keep the furnace from cycling on and off too frequently. Catastrophic bifurcations usually exhibit hysteresis, whereas subtle bifurcations do not.
These four-dimensional maps are also well suited for color holographic display or for experimentation with virtual reality, in which the view is controlled by the motion of your head and hands to give the sensation of moving through the object. The technology is complicated, but the results are visually and mentally stimulating.</code></pre>

<p>#Fields and Flows
In this chapter, we consider equations whose iterates move gradually rather than abruptly from one place to another. Such equations are called differential equations, and they are the basis for most dynamical systems that describe natural processes. The programming is a simple extension of what we have done before, but the calculation requires more computing time. The attractors produced by differential equations consist of continuous lines whose weavings and waverings describe the trajectory and yield objects of considerable beauty.</p>
</div>
<div id="beam-me-up-scotty" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.16</span> Beam Me up Scotty!</h2>
<pre><code>Successive iterates of the maps in the previous chapters are usually at widely different positions on the attractors. The points dance around like fleas jumping on the back of a dog, eventually, but gradually, visiting every allowed location. Most processes in nature don’t occur that way but progress slowly and continuously from some initial condition through a succession of nearby intermediate states to the final condition.
If you take a trip across the country, your trajectory through three-dimensional space (or even in four-dimensional space-time) is a continuous one-dimensional curve. Only in science fiction is Captain Kirk able to dematerialize at one position and rematerialize somewhere else, without occupying a succession of intermediate positions. Most substances in nature obey a continuity equation, which guarantees that if their quantity decreases at some position, the decrease must be accompanied by a flow of the substance away from the position. Note that this is a stronger condition than a conservation law, which requires only that the total quantity of the substance remains the same.
There is a relation between flows and maps. Imagine a fly trapped in a room and moving in a complicated, random manner. Its trajectory is a one-dimensional curve that eventually fills the entire room. However, if you observe the fly with a strobe lamp that flashes periodically, the trajectory is a succession of dots, with each dot separated from the previous dot by a significant distance. The dots also eventually fill the entire three-dimensional region, but it takes longer for this to occur.
However, if the fly’s motion is chaotic rather than random, neither the curve nor the dots fill the room; rather, they lie on a strange attractor that occupies a negligible portion of the room. The attractor consisting of all the possible dots often has a lower dimension than the attractor consisting of all the possible curves. Thus a map can be thought of as a crude description of a flow, in which the intervening details of the motion are ignored.
It’s easy to think of an object such as a fly or a human, imbued with intelligence, however limited, moving by free will along a complicated trajectory. However, inanimate objects, such as astronomical bodies or sub-microscopic, electrically charged particles, can also execute complicated motions. They do so because they move through a space filled with gravitational or electromagnetic fields.
It is important to recognize that a field has no objective reality other than to describe mathematically the force on an object moving through it. When something is dropped, it falls toward Earth. It is a deeply philosophical question, not answered very well by science, how the object knows to move toward Earth rather than in some other direction. We say that it is acted upon by the gravitational field of the Earth, but this description, however useful for calculating the motion, begs the issue. Ultimately, the laws of physics describe very accurately how things move, but not very well why.
The equations that describe flows are of a different type than those that describe maps. They are called differential equations, and they involve the rate of change of a quantity. We will consider only ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as distinguished from the partial differential equations (PDEs) used to describe the behavior of complicated objects like fluids that have intrinsically infinite-dimensional state spaces. Dynamical systems described by ODEs involve only the time rate of change of the position of a point in state space, whereas with PDEs, the variables are quantities like density, temperature, and electric field that change in space as well as time. A wave is an example of a dynamical system described by a PDE.
Consider an object moving in the X direction. Its speed is the rate of change of its position, and we will denote this quantity by X’ (pronounced “X prime”). It is the distance the object moves in a brief interval of time divided by the time interval. If you know some calculus, you recognize this as the time-derivative of X, usually denoted by dX/dt. The rate of change of position is what the speedometer on your car, or the police radar, reads. The rate of change of the speed is the acceleration. More properly, we should call these quantities the time rate of change, since quantities can also change in space. For example, the spatial rate of change in altitude of a road is called its grade.
An object moving in three-dimensional space has a constantly changing value not only of X but also of Y and Z. Furthermore, X’, Y’, and Z’ usually depend on position (X, Y, and Z). For example, a particle moving clockwise in a circle about the origin in the XY plane is described by the following pair of differential equations:

X’ = Y
Y’ = -X                         (Equation 6A)</code></pre>
<p>Such a set of equations describes, at least approximately, the motion of the earth around the sun. This type of regular motion is not chaotic, and it does not lead to visually interesting strange attractors.
Some differential equations can be solved easily using calculus. For example, Equation 6A has the solution</p>
<pre><code>X = A sin(t + f)
Y = A cos(t + f)                    (Equation 6B)</code></pre>
<p>which specifies the X and Y positions at any time t. The quantities A and  are constants that are determined from the initial conditions (the values of X and Y at t = 0). If you are interested only in the shape of the trajectory, and not in where the object is along it at any particular time, you can eliminate the t in Equations 6B to get a relation between X and Y,</p>
<pre><code>X2 + Y2 = A2                       (Equation 6C)</code></pre>
<p>which is the equation for a circle of radius A centered on the origin (X = Y = 0).
Equation 6A also arises in a different context. Imagine an object moving back and forth in the X direction, perhaps attached to a spring that alternately stretches and compresses. Since Y is equal to X’, we can associate Y with the velocity in the X direction. The XY plane then becomes the two-dimensional phase space for this one-dimensional motion, and the trajectory in this plane is the phase-space trajectory. A circular phase-space trajectory is a characteristic of a one-dimensional, simple harmonic oscillator, such as a mass on a spring. Usually the phase-space trajectory is an ellipse, just as the orbit of the earth around the sun is an ellipse, but we can always measure Y in appropriate units, or adjust the scale of the graph, to change the ellipse into a circle.
With this interpretation, the first part of Equation 6A defines the velocity (Y) as the rate of change of position (X’). If you remember your physics, the second part of Equation 6A is Newton’s second law (F = ma), in which the force F obeys Hooke’s law for springs (F = - kX), and the acceleration a is the rate of change of velocity (Y’). It is interesting that the same set of differential equations with a change in the meaning of the variables can describe the motion of an object traveling in a circle or an object oscillating on the end of a spring. Equation 6A describes many other phenomena in nature, such as the oscillations in an electrical circuit containing a capacitor and inductor.
A two-dimensional system of differential equations such as Equation 6A cannot exhibit chaos, according to the Poincaré-Bendixon theorem, because the trajectory cannot cross itself. The most complicated bounded behavior is thus a simple closed loop, corresponding to periodic motion. The reason the trajectory cannot cross itself is that every point in the XY plane has associated with it a unique direction of flow, so the trajectory must approach and leave every point in a single particular direction. If the orbit were to return to a point previously visited, it would thereafter repeat what it did before. In two dimensions, the orbit can do only one of three things: spiral into a fixed point, approach a stable limit cycle, or spiral off to infinity.
Trajectories may appear to cross if they come very close to a fixed point that is stable in one direction and unstable in another (called a saddle point or X point because of its shape). Such a trajectory is called a separatrix because it separates regions with different flows. Trajectories approaching the fixed point on one side of the separatrix veer off to the right, and those approaching from the other side veer off to the left. Such a separatrix exists upstream (and downstream) of an island in a river where two sticks placed side by side in the water end up going around opposite sides of the island. The island seems at first to attract the sticks and then to repel them at right angles as they approach it.
In three dimensions, we have the possibility of an orbit wrapping around in a complicated manner, like a ball of string, never intersecting itself, but producing a never-ending tangle. By contrast, maps can be chaotic in one or two dimensions because the points jump from place to place with little danger of intersecting another point. Captain Kirk need not be concerned about a collision while being transported from one point to another. He only needs to worry about landing on top of a diabolical Romulan at his destination!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.17</span> Professor Lorenz and Dr. Rössler</h2>
<pre><code>Although differential equations have been the mathematical basis for most descriptions of nature for hundreds of years, almost no one suspected that the trajectories resulting from their solution could be a chaotic strange attractor. The history of the discovery of such solutions is interesting and bears retelling.
In the early 1960s, Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was developing models of atmospheric convection to be solved by a primitive computer that required about one second per iteration. His models involved a large number of differential equations and produced solutions that varied with time in a complicated manner, not unlike the variation of the weather over long intervals of time. On one occasion, he happened to restart one of his computer runs using numbers rounded to three digits rather than the six significant figures used by the computer.
For some time, the solutions followed one another, but after a while they began to depart, and eventually they bore no relation to one another. He had discovered the sensitivity to initial conditions that is perhaps the most salient feature of chaos. He began simplifying his equations in an attempt to determine the minimum conditions necessary for this bizarre behavior. The result is the now famous Lorenz equations, which represent the first example of a strange attractor arising from differential equations,

X’ = s(Y - X)
Y’ = -XZ + rX - Y
Z’ = XY - bZ                        (Equation 6D)</code></pre>
<p>where , r, and b are constants that Lorenz took to be  = 10, r = 28, and b = 8/3. Lorenz published his findings in 1963 in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, where they went largely unnoticed for the next decade. The title of his paper, “Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow,” is an apt description of what we now call chaos.
Although the Lorenz equations were distilled from a model of atmospheric convection, the trajectory in XYZ space does not represent air currents in any literal way. Instead, X corresponds to the size of the convective motion, Y is proportional to the temperature difference between the ascending and descending fluids, and Z is proportional to the deviation of the vertical temperature profile from a linear function. Nevertheless, the behavior is reminiscent of a fluid with turbulent convection.
Since the Lorenz equations were proposed, several phenomena have been found that are at least approximately modeled by them. Perhaps the simplest example is the thermosiphon. Imagine a continuous tube, like a bicycle tube, filled with a liquid and mounted vertically. If the bottom of the tube is heated and the top cooled, a convection ensues, with the warm fluid rising and the cold fluid falling. The convection is equally likely to start in either direction. After it starts, the circulation continues in that direction a few times around the loop and then abruptly reverses.
In the 1970s other examples of chaotic differential equations began to be discovered. An important contribution was made in 1976 by Otto Rössler, a nonpracticing medical doctor in Germany. Rössler was interested in chaos in chemistry and theoretical biology, and he set about to find a system of equations even simpler than those of Lorenz that exhibited chaotic behavior. What he came up with are the now famous Rössler equations:</p>
<pre><code>X’ = -(Y + Z)
Y’ = X + aY
Z’ = b + Z(X - c)                   (Equation 6E)</code></pre>
<p>where a, b, and c are constants that Rössler took to be a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7. The Rössler equations are sometimes described as the simplest known example of chaos arising from a system of ordinary differential equations. They contain a single nonlinearity (ZX in the third equation). Rössler’s original paper is also interesting because it contains a stereoscopic view of his strange attractor as well as the Lorenz attractor.
Until very recently, the discovery of a new strange attractor was a cause to rush to publication. With the program in this book, you can produce them by the thousands! Even today researchers tend to focus on a few well-known examples such as the Lorenz and Rössler attractors. An entire book has been written on the Lorenz attractor alone. Think of the libraries that could be filled by books describing your attractors in similar detail!
The Lorenz and Rössler attractors are shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2, respectively, albeit with slightly different values of the parameters than they used. These cases are known to have fractal dimensions slightly greater than 2.0. These examples are more important for their historical interest than for their visual appeal. If you have never seen these attractors in 3-D, be sure to return to these cases and view them with the various display techniques after the program has been appropriately modified, as described in the next section. The Lorenz attractor resembles the wings of a butterfly, making it an appropriate emblem of chaos, since the sensitivity to initial conditions is most dramatically illustrated by the butterfly effect.</p>

<div id="finite-differences" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.18</span> Finite Differences</h2>
<pre><code>Some differential equations, such as Equation 6A, can be solved exactly in a straightforward manner using calculus. However, if a system of equations exhibits chaos, no such solution is possible. The reason is that no mathematical function analogous to the sine and cosine can describe a strange attractor the way those functions describe a circle. The equations must be solved by computer. We say that such solutions are numerical as opposed to analytical.
Unfortunately, digital computers, which are ideal for iterating maps, are inherently incapable of exactly solving differential equations. The equations require that the solution advance slowly and smoothly. That is, the successive iterates must differ by an infinitesimal amount, thus infinitely many iterations are required to make any progress. Special analog computers have been designed for the task, but they are not common or simple to program.
Books have been written on methods for the approximate numerical solution of differential equations, and it is as much an art as a science. All the methods involve, in one form or another, a finite-difference approximation to the differential equation. Rather than taking infinitesimal steps, one advances in finite steps according to a prescription that attempts to minimize the inevitable errors. Fortunately, for our purpose, our solutions need not be highly accurate, so we can use a simple procedure.
Perhaps the easiest and most transparent method for finding approximate solutions to differential equations is the Euler method. When this procedure is applied to the simple example of Equation 6A, X and Y are advanced according to

Xn+1 = Xn + eYn
Yn+1 = Yn - eXn                     (Equation 6F)</code></pre>
<p>where  is the time step that ideally should be negligibly small but in reality is made as large as possible to reduce the number of iterations required to advance the solution by a substantial distance along the trajectory. You see that the Euler method provides just another example of an iterated map in which successive iterates are near one another. It is perhaps the least accurate method for solving differential equations, and it is easily improved upon. However, for most of our purposes, the Euler method is adequate. Furthermore, it is simple to modify the program to solve differential equations by this method. The necessary changes are shown in PROG21.</p>

In PROG21, the value of  is 0.1, and the three-dimensional equations are polynomials up to fifth order, with coefficients chosen by analogy to the three-dimensional polynomial maps previously described. We don’t consider differential equations in less than three dimensions because they cannot have chaotic solutions. The second-order through fifth-order equations are coded with the first letters Q, R, S, and T, respectively.
If  is sufficiently small, its value should not affect whether a system is chaotic or the general appearance of the attractor, but it certainly changes the trajectory on the attractor. Just as a chaotic trajectory is sensitive to initial conditions, it also is sensitive to the approximations used to calculate it. Unfortunately, a value of  = 0.1 is not sufficiently small, and many of the resulting attractors would disappear or change their appearance if  were reduced. Conversely, other attractors would emerge for smaller values of . Fortunately, for our purposes, the solutions need not be even qualitatively correct. Be forewarned that reducing  has unpredictable effects on the attractors and increases the computation time.
The Lyapunov exponent is calculated as with the corresponding maps, except that it is divided by ; thus its units are bits per second rather than bits per iteration, because each iteration advances the solution by  seconds. It is customary to express the Lyapunov exponent in this way for differential equations because the step size depends on the numerical approximation that is being used, whereas the divergence of the trajectories per unit time is an intrinsic property of the differential equations.
Sample attractors produced by three-dimensional ordinary differential equations projected onto the XY plane are shown in Figures 6-3 through 6-6.</p>

<pre><code>These figures are like time-exposed photographs of the shadow on the wall of a fly moving chaotically in a room. However, because of the finite difference approximation used to solve the equation of motion, you must imagine that the fly is illuminated by a strobe lamp that flashes rapidly. The trajectory thus consists of a large number of closely spaced dots. The separation of the dots provides a measure of the accuracy of the solution. Although some of the cases produce apparently continuous trajectories, others more nearly resemble the maps of the previous chapters. You might prefer to alter the program so that the dots are connected by lines. This is most easily done by changing line 5060 to </code></pre>

<pre><code>Another consequence of dealing with differential equations is that many iterations are required for the solution to settle onto the attractor. Since we use the same criterion for the number of iterations as we did for the maps, a significant number (perhaps 20%) of the attractors found in a random search are not chaotic, and a few are even unbounded. When you evaluate the attractors found by the search, you will recognize these cases by the way they eventually settle onto a simple closed loop that is visually indistinguishable from a limit cycle, spiral into a fixed point, or leave the screen. You will also notice a few cases that consist of isolated islands with no bridge connecting them, such as the one in Figure 6-3. You can be sure these are not true flows, because such discontinuities are impossible in the trajectories that arise from the solution of our differential equations.
There is no reason to limit the display of attractors arising from differential equations to projections onto a plane. All the display techniques developed in Chapter 4 for three-dimensional maps are also available here. Figures 6-7 through 6-22 and Plates 23 and 24 show a selection of such examples.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.20</span> Strange Attractors that Aren’t</h2>
<pre><code>In Section 3.8, we discussed chaotic orbits that don’t approach an attractor (“Strange Attractors that Don’t”). Here we consider nonchaotic orbits that approach attractors that aren’t strange. These attractors are not fractals. They have dimensions that are integers such as 0, 1, 2, or 3. Some of them are beautiful, so they are worth displaying even if they are technically outside the scope of this book.
Such attractors can arise from maps as well as from differential equations. They don’t require high embedding dimensions, although the dimension of the attractor always is at least one less than the dimension of the embedding space. Thus some of the examples are taken from equations described in earlier chapters.
The simplest nonchaotic attractor is a point attractor. Suppose we modified Equation 6A so the solution is not a circle but an inward spiral. One way to do this is as follows:

X’ = Y - bX
Y’ = -X - bY                        (Equation 6G)</code></pre>
<p>You can think of the coefficient b as a measure of the friction that eventually brings the trajectory to rest at the origin (X = Y = 0) in phase space. If b is zero (frictionless), the orbit is a circle. Negative values of b (antifriction) cause the solution to spiral outward, approaching infinity. This case corresponds to a point repellor at the origin. An attractive fixed point is called a sink and a repelling fixed point is called a source. Some authors reserve the term fixed point for maps and prefer to call the stationary solutions of ODEs critical points or equilibrium points.
The two occurrences of b in Equation 6G need not have the same value or even the same sign. In such a case, the orbit moves in or out but not in a symmetrical manner. Many physical processes have b = 0 in one of the equations. If b is close to zero, it doesn’t matter much in which equation it appears.
If b is zero in one of the equations above, small positive values of the other b cause the radius of the circle to decrease slowly, approaching what is called a spiral-point or focal-point attractor, or simply a focus. Larger positive values of b cause the radius to decrease more rapidly. With very large values of b, there is little circulation around the point, and the trajectory is more nearly radial toward what is called a radial-point or nodal-point attractor, or simply a node. The boundary between the two cases occurs at b = 2 and corresponds to critical damping in an oscillator. In either case, the resulting attractor is a point at the origin with a dimension of zero. A code that produces a point attractor (with b = 1) is QMLM3NM5LM3LM14. For this case, the largest Lyapunov exponent is negative (L = - 0.1/ln 2 = - 0.14), and it produces a single dot on the screen.
More interesting cases can occur because the program assumes the trajectory is on the attractor after 1000 iterations. For trajectories that approach the attractor very slowly, there can be interesting behavior after the thousandth iteration and before the fixed point is reached. Such slowly attracting fixed points have negative Lyapunov exponents, at least one of which is very close to zero. The search can be expanded to include them as well as other nonchaotic attractors by changing the .005 in line 2480 of the program to -.005, for example. Then attractors that have Lyapunov exponents near zero but have not settled to a fixed point after NMAX iterations are included in the file SA.DIC. If you prefer, you can collect them in a separate file TORUS.DIC by changing line 4910 of PROG21 to</p>
<p>4910 IF L &gt; .005 THEN OPEN “SA.DIC” FOR APPEND AS #1 ELSE OPEN “TORUS.DIC” FOR APPEND AS #1</p>
<pre><code>Several such cases are shown in Figures 6-39 through 6-42. Figure 6-39 shows a spiral-point attractor. Figure 6-40 shows what appears to be a radial-point attractor with several different initial conditions; it is really a spiral-point attractor with successive iterates that move rapidly around the fixed point. This phenomenon is called aliasing, and it is most easily detected by connecting temporally successive points with continuous lines. Figures 6-41 and 6-42 show cases where the rate of circulation around the fixed point changes significantly as the fixed point is approached.</code></pre>

<pre><code>The point attractor is the simplest type of nonchaotic attractor. It has a dimension of zero. An attractor can also have a dimension of one, which is a line. Such attractors are limit cycles. They correspond to systems that settle into a periodic or cyclic behavior. Consequently, such attractors are also called cyclic attractors.
The simplest differential equations that produce a cyclic trajectory are the equations in Equation 6A. The resulting orbit is a circle in the XY plane. This case is not an attractor, however, because every initial condition produces a circular trajectory whose radius is the distance of the initial point from the origin. There is no unique circle to which nearby orbits are attracted, and there is no basin of attraction. Furthermore, if you attempt to display the trajectory using a code such as QM5NM5LM18, you will find that the orbit is unbounded and spirals outward as if there were a point repellor at the origin. The reason is that our iteration scheme for approximating the solution of the differential equations is not exact. The errors compound and eventually cause the orbit to be lost.
The simple undamped (frictionless) oscillator is said to be structurally unstable because an arbitrarily small perturbation to the equation (such as using the Euler finite difference approximation of Equation 6F) changes the structure of the solution from a closed loop to a never-ending spiral. Note the distinction between an unstable equation, in which a small modification of the equation causes a large change in the solution, and an unstable solution, in which a small variation of the initial condition away from the equilibrium value causes the solution to move ever farther from equilibrium.
To produce a true limit cycle that is structurally stable, we need a system of equations whose solutions spiral outward from initial conditions in the interior and spiral inward from initial conditions on the exterior of the attractor. A suitable set of such equations is the following:

X’ = Y + (1 - X2 - Y2)X
Y’ = -X + (1 - X2 - Y2)Y                (Equation 6H)</code></pre>
<p>The quantity (1 - X2 - Y2) plays the role of -b in Equation 6G. Whenever the trajectory lies inside the circle of radius one, it spirals outward, and whenever it lies outside the circle of radius one, it spirals inward. Thus the limit cycle is defined by the circle X2 + Y2 = 1. There is a point repellor at the origin, and the basin of attraction is the entire XY plane. A code that produces such a stable limit cycle, except with a smaller radius is RMNMAM3AM3NM9LM2AM6NMAM26.
A limit cycle may be either stable or unstable, just like a fixed point. With an unstable limit cycle, nearby orbits move progressively farther from the limit cycle. An unstable limit cycle can be identified in an invertable map or system of ordinary differential equations by running time backwards, in which case the limit cycle becomes stable and attracts rather than repels nearby orbits.
A slightly simpler version of Equation 6H that produces a stable limit cycle, although not a symmetrical one, is the following:</p>
<pre><code>X’ = Y
Y’ = -X + (1 - X2)Y                 (Equation 6I)</code></pre>
<p>This system is called the Van der Pol equation, and it was first used to model vacuum-tube oscillator circuits, but it has been used in other applications such as the modeling of pulsating stars called Cephids. A code for the Van der Pol equation is RM11OM9KM2KM6OM28.
Such limit cycles are characterized by a dimension of one and a Lyapunov exponent of zero. The dimension as approximated by the program will usually not be exactly 1.0 for the reasons discussed in Section 3.4. The Lyapunov exponent is a much better criterion for identifying limit cycles. In a two-dimensional embedding space, as in the previous examples, there are two Lyapunov exponents. The smaller (more negative) of them is the rate at which trajectories with different initial conditions approach the attractor. The larger exponent (the one calculated by the program) is the rate at which two nearby points on the limit cycle separate. For a limit cycle produced by ODEs, this exponent must be zero because points along the trajectory are governed by the same rates of flow, except delayed in time.
In two dimensions, the limit cycles cannot cross, so the most complicated shapes are simple distorted loops. In three or more dimensions, they can wrap around in a complicated tangle like a ball of string, but without ends. Figures 6-43 through 6-50 show a collection of visually interesting limit cycles. They are plotted as stereo pairs so that you can see how the trajectories pass beneath one another.</p>

<pre><code>As you examine the figures, note that some of the limit cycles, such as the one in Figure 6-43, form knots. You cannot straighten them out into circular loops. By contrast, Figure 6-47 is unknotted. This knottedness or helicity is an important topological property of an attractor. Some processes in nature tend to conserve helicity, just as mechanical energy is conserved in frictionless motion. Thus when some parameter of the system is changed, the limit cycle may change its size and shape but in such a way that it always links itself in the same way. An example is a magnetic field line in a turbulent conducting fluid such as a plasma of electrically charged particles.
For many of the limit cycles exhibited here, it is very hard to tell whether they are knotted. Even when they appear to be knotted, it is hard to tell whether two cases are knotted in the same way. Such patterns might provide a useful psychological test for one’s spatial acuity because they require both depth perception and a mental dexterity to visualize their shape when untangled as much as possible. See which of the limit cycles in the figures you think are knotted.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.21</span> Doughnuts and Coffee Cups</h2>
<pre><code>Non-chaotic attractors can be points or lines. They can also be surfaces. Surfaces are two-dimensional manifolds. Perhaps the simplest set of equations whose solution is a trajectory that fills a surface is the following:

X’ = Y
Y’ = -X
Z’ = aW
W’ = -Z                         (Equation 6J)</code></pre>
<p>You will recognize the first two equations as the same as Equation 6A that produces a circle in the XY plane. The second two equations produce an ellipse in the ZW plane. The two motions are uncoupled (X and Y don’t depend on Z or W; Z and W don’t depend on X or Y). The parameter a is the square of the angular frequency of the second motion. If the square root of a is a rational number (a ratio of two integers) the trajectory is a closed one-dimensional loop in the four-dimensional embedding space.
If the square root of a is irrational, the trajectory fills a two-dimensional toroidal surface (called a 2-torus). The trajectory winds endlessly around the surface of a dougnut, never intersecting itself. In such a case we say the frequencies (the number of transits per second the long way around and the short way around) are incommensurate and that the trajectory is quasi-periodic. The sequence never repeats, but it is not chaotic. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between quasi-periodic and chaotic behavior.
A useful tool for distinguishing between a quasi-periodic and a chaotic attractor is the power spectrum of the time series, which has sharp peaks at discrete frequencies for quasi-periodic trajectories but a broad (continuous) spectrum for chaotic trajectories. The power spectrum contains about half of the information required to reconstruct the trajectory; the frequency information is present, but the phase information is lost. Nevertheless, the power spectrum serves as a kind of fingerprint that is very useful in categorizing attractors.
The equation set in Equation 6J has the same problems as Equation 6A. They don’t represent an attractor because nearly all initial conditions produce different tori. Furthermore, the tori produced in this way are structurally unstable, just like the circles of Equation 6A. These difficulties can be circumvented by using instead an extension of Equations 6H to produce two uncoupled limit cycles as follows:</p>
<pre><code>X’ = Y + (1 - X2 - Y2)X
Y’ = -X + (1 - X2 - Y2)Y
Z = aW + (1 - Z2 - W2)Z
W = -Z + (1 - Z2 - W2)W             (Equation 6K)</code></pre>
<p>A value of a = 2 provides an acceptable irrational frequency ratio, because the square root of 2 cannot be represented as a ratio of two integers. The corresponding trajectory can be generated using the code VMNMAM4AM7NM19LM2-AM11NMAM42NMAM2AOM28LM2AM2NMA. A rotated version of the 2-torus in which one loop is in the XZ plane and the other is in the YW plane is produced by the code VMNMAM8AM13NM24NMAM6AM6OM3LM3AM20NMAM22L-M3AM11NMA.
Two uncoupled limit cycles lie on a torus that is attractive, but it is not technically an attractor; it is called an invariant manifold. For an object to be an attractor, it must not only attract nearby trajectories, but most trajectories on it must wander all over it, in which case we say the set is transitive and the orbits are ergodic. Ergodic orbits produce mixing, which means that an orbit starting from anywhere on the attractor eventually comes arbitrarily close to every other point on the attractor. Mixing ensures that an attractor cannot be split into two different attractors, although the attractor need not be connected. Figure 5-11 shows an attractor that is not connected. Thus not all attractive tori are attractors, just as not all attractors are tori.
Tori can be identified in the computer search by a Lyapunov exponent close to zero and a dimension well above one. It is easy to distinguish them visually from limit cycles, which also have Lyapunov exponents close to zero but resemble lines rather than surfaces. A selection of tori projected onto the XY plane is shown in Figures 6-51 through 6-60.</p>

<pre><code>Most of the attractors shown in the figures look like tori in the sense that you can see or imagine the hole in the doughnut. However, it is important to understand that, just as not all limit cycles are circles, not all 2-tori look like doughnuts. They are topologically equivalent in the sense that there is a “rubber-sheet” deformation (called a homeomorphism) that maps them into a doughnut. A coffee cup, for example, is topologically equivalent to a doughnut as long as the handle is unbroken.
Those cases that are not obviously equivalent to a simple torus are distorted by the fact that they are viewed projected onto the XY plane or because they are rotated at an awkward angle. Also note that most of these tori are embedded in a four-dimensional space, so it is even more difficult to grasp their shape from a two-dimensional projection. You might want to display them using some of the advanced visualization techniques provided by the program.
It is possible, though difficult, to produce a 3-torus in a four-dimensional embedding space. A 3-torus is a generalization of a 2-torus. It is hard to visualize. It involves three mutually incommensurate frequencies. It is characterized by a dimension of three and a largest Lyapunov exponent of zero. Some of the attractors in the figures seem to be 3-tori according to their calculated dimension. However, the calculation is not sufficiently precise to distinguish unambiguously between a 2-torus and a 3-torus. It is necessary to search embedding dimensions greater than four to have a good chance of finding 3-tori.
Dynamical systems whose trajectories lie on a 3-torus or other hypertori of even higher dimensions are difficult to observe in nature. The reason is that such attractors can be perturbed by an arbitrarily small change to the system that causes them to become strange attractors. According to Peixoto’s theorem (which strictly applies only to compact, orientable manifolds), 2-tori tend to be structurally stable, while 3-tori and higher are structurally unstable. Thus it appears that complicated deterministic systems that exhibit nontrivial behavior are well represented by the strange attractors that constitute the subject of this book.</code></pre>
