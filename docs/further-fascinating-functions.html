<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Further Fascinating Functions</h1>
<p>For a system of equations to exhibit chaos, the equations must contain at least one nonlinear term, that is, a term that is not simply proportional to one of the variables. In all the preceding examples, the nonlinearity involved simple polynomials. Such polynomials are capable of modeling an enormous variety of physical phenomena. Virtually all nonlinear functions can be approximated by polynomials with sufficiently many terms. However, by limiting the polynomials to fifth order, we have missed many interesting possibilities. In this chapter we examine a few of these possibilities and suggest others that you might want to explore on your own.</p>
<div id="steps-and-tents" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Steps and Tents</h2>
<pre><code>Perhaps the simplest nonlinear function is the absolute value, which is denoted by |X| and programmed in BASIC with the command ABS(X). The absolute value of X is the magnitude of X without regard to its sign. For example, if X is -6 then |X| is 6. It is a nonlinear function because a graph of |X| versus X is a V-shaped curve with its notch at the origin rather than a straight line as would result if |X| were proportional to X. By adding linear terms, the V can be rotated to resemble an L or a staircase step. Computers can evaluate ABS(X) very quickly, since they only need to discard the sign.
An example of a one-dimensional chaotic map that involves |X| is the tent map, so called because its graph is an inverted V. A tent map that maps the interval -1 to 1 back onto itself is</code></pre>
<p><span class="math display">\[  
Xn+1 = 1 - 2|Xn|     
\]</span></p>
<p>The behavior of Equation 7A is very similar to the behavior of the logistic equation (Equation 1C) with R = 4, which maps the interval 0 to 1 back onto itself. A mapping that returns a set onto itself is called an endomorphism.
Since one-dimensional maps tend not to be very interesting visually, we can generalize Equation 7A to two dimensions as follows:
<span class="math display">\[
    Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Yn + a4|Xn| + a5|Yn|
    \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
    Yn+1 = a6 + a7Xn + a8Yn + a9|Xn| + a10|Yn|      
\]</span>
This form is analogous to the general two-dimensional quadratic map in Equation 3B.
To make things a little more interesting, we can add two more dimensions (Z and W) to take advantage of the visualization techniques that we have previously developed. However, to keep things simple, we will demand that X and Y not depend on Z or W. They are just along for the ride, so to speak. The dynamical behavior is determined only by X and Y. We can choose any convenient equation for Z and for W. One possibility is to evaluate Z from X and Y according to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    Zn+1 = Xn2 + Yn2                
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus Z is the square of the distance of the previous iterate from the origin. You might want to experiment with other forms.
For the fourth dimension (W), we will do something completely different. We will arrange for W to increase linearly with the iteration number. Thus W becomes the time coordinate in four-dimensional space-time.
The program modifications required to extend the computer search to such cases are shown in PROG22. Codes for this case begin with the letter Y.</p>

<pre><code>Examples of attractors produced by PROG22 are shown in Figures 7-1 through 7-8. They are displayed as projections onto the XY plane to let you observe the higher dimensional representations for the first time on your computer screen. Note that these attractors differ from the cases produced by polynomials in that they tend to have sharp angular corners. The one in Figure 7-3 is not an attractor but is an example of an area-preserving system sometimes called the gingerbread man because of its shape.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> ANDs and ORs</h2>
<pre><code>A very different type of nonlinear map can be produced using logical (Boolean) operations to manipulate the individual bits of the binary numbers that represent the variables. This is best done after rounding the variables to the nearest integer using the BASIC CINT function. As a variation, you could use the FIX or INT function, both of which truncate rather than round. Most versions of BASIC automatically apply the CINT function before performing logical operations on numbers that are not integers. The conversion of a noninteger to an integer is itself a nonlinear operation, because the graph of CINT(X) versus X resembles a staircase.
The basic logical operators are AND and OR. If you are not sure what these operations mean, your BASIC manual is a good reference. The operation X AND Y produces a new number whose bits are 1 if the corresponding bits of X and Y are both 1, and 0 otherwise. The operation X OR Y produces a new number whose bits are 1 if either (or both) of the corresponding bits of X or Y are 1, and 0 otherwise. This is also called the inclusive OR to distinguish it from the exclusive OR (XOR), which produces a number whose bits are 1 if either (but not both) of the corresponding bits of X or Y are 1, and 0 otherwise.
The following is a general two-dimensional system of equations that includes the AND and OR operators:

Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Yn + a4Xn AND a5Yn + a6Xn OR a7Yn

<pre><code>Polynomial maps involve powers of the variables that are small positive integers, such as the square (2) and the cube (3). Polynomials exclude such nonlinearities as the square root or the reciprocal of the variables. Roots and powers are mathematically equivalent except for the value of the exponent. The square root of X can be written as X0.5, and the reciprocal of X can be written as 1/X or as X-1. It is interesting to examine strange attractors that involve fractional and negative powers.
The following is a general two-dimensional system of equations that involves arbitrary powers:

Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Yn + a4|Xn|a5 + a6|Yn|a7
Yn+1 = a8 + a9Xn + a10Yn + a11|Xn|a12 + a13|Yn|a14  (Equation 7E)</code></pre>
<p>The absolute values are needed because BASIC cannot take a root of a negative number. The result would have an imaginary component. Note that if all the exponents happen to be +1, Equation 7E is equivalent to Equation 7B. The third and fourth dimensions are determined in the same way as in Section 7.1.
The program modifications required to extend the computer search to such cases are shown in PROG24. Since we have exhausted the capital letter codes, we must invent some new ones. We will continue using the standard ASCII characters beyond Z, as shown in Table 2-1. Thus the codes for this case begin with the left bracket ([), which is ASCII 91.</p>

<pre><code>Examples of attractors produced by PROG24 are shown in Figures 7-17 through 7-24. These attractors are localized mostly to a small region of the XY plane with tentacles that stretch out to large distances. If any of the exponents are negative and the attractor intersects the line along which the respective variable is zero, a point on the line maps to infinity. However, large values are visited infrequently by the orbit, so many iterations are required to determine that the orbit is unbounded. For this reason most of the attractors in the figures have holes in their interiors where their orbits are precluded from coming too close to their origins (X = Y = 0).</code></pre>

<pre><code>You may become frustrated seeing a beautiful attractor develop for thousands of iterations and then having the orbit escape. Such behavior is called a crisis or transient chaos, not to be confused with a catastrophe. For example, the logistic equation with R slightly greater than 4.0 is chaotic for many iterations until an iterate happens to exceed 1.0, whereupon the orbit abruptly moves off toward infinity.  By contrast, a catastrophe occurs when the solution undergoes a qualitative change at some critical value of a control parameter.
Related to a crisis is another phenomenon called intermittency. At certain values of the control parameters, a system exhibits periodic behavior for many cycles and then suddenly becomes chaotic for a while before settling back into periodic behavior. Classic examples of intermittency occur in the logistic equation at about R = 3.82812 and in the Lorenz equations at about r = 166.2. Intermittency has been observed in many natural systems, and it is a bane to those who try to make predictions. It is possible that the solar system is intermittently chaotic or even that a crisis can occur leading to a complete loss of its stability, perhaps precipitated by a rare conjunction of a planet with a large asteroid or comet.
Those solutions of Equation 7E that remain bounded tend to have a wispy appearance and to go beyond the frame of the figure because of the occasional large excursions. Artistically, this feature gives the attractors a sense of being connected to the surrounding world rather than being isolated objects suspended in a void. If you frame these cases, a surrounding mat is desirable to provide the illusion that they are being viewed through a window.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Sines and Cosines</h2>
<pre><code>Two of the most common nonlinear functions are the sine and its complement, the cosine. The sine and cosine can be approximated by polynomials as follows:

sin X = X - X3/6 + X5 /120 - X7/5040 + ...
cos X = 1 - X2/2 + X4/24 - X6/720 + ...         (Equation 7F)</code></pre>
<p>When the argument X is small, the approximations are very accurate using only a few terms in the expansion. The denominator of each term is the factorial of the exponent of that term. For example, the factorial of five (written 5!) is equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. When X is large, many terms are required. In such a case, we would expect to observe dynamics different from those produced by the fifth-order polynomials previously examined.
A general two-dimensional system of equations whose nonlinearity is restricted to the sine function is the following:</p>
<pre><code>Xn+1 = a1 + a2Xn + a3Yn + a4sin(a5Xn + a6) + a7sin(a8Yn + a9)

<pre><code>In this section, we consider a special type of map that involves sines and cosines. The solutions are chaotic, but they are not attractors. The systems they describe are Hamiltonian. Such Hamiltonian systems obey the Liouville theorem, which states that the phase-space volume occupied by a set of points is conserved as the system evolves in time. Thus the orbit eventually returns arbitrarily close to any initial condition. Contrast this to dissipative systems in which the phase-space volume decreases in time, eventually collapsing all initial conditions within the basin of attraction onto the attractor. In dissipative systems, the basin of attraction is usually much larger than the attractor. The equations are as follows:

Xn+1 = 10a1 + [Xn + a2sin(a3Yn + a4)]cos a + Yn sin a
Yn+1 = 10a5 - [Xn + a2sin(a3Yn + a4)]sin a + Yn cos a   (Equation 7H)</code></pre>
<p>where  = 2 / (13 + 10a6). The third and fourth dimensions are determined in the same way as in Section 7.1.
The special form of Equation 7H guarantees that the solution is not only area-preserving but also has circular symmetry. Furthermore, an inherent periodicity arises from the fact that  is 2 divided by an integer that ranges from 1 to 25. The periodicity is indicated by the last letter of the code (a6): A for period-1, B for period-2, and so forth. Because of the circular symmetry and infinite extent, it is interesting to project these cases onto a sphere using the P command.

<pre><code>As you watch the patterns develop, you can see the orbit wander throughout the XY plane along a network of channels. The network is infinite in extent and is called a stochastic web. The global wandering is evidence of minimal chaos, and it causes the orbit eventually to leave the boundary of the computer screen. If you interrupt the calculation at some point, the resulting structure resembles a wreath or a snowflake. The infinite structure is a tiling, but its symmetry is slightly spoiled by the finite thickness of the web. This breaking of the symmetry eliminates the monotony and contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the patterns.
The slow wandering of the orbit throughout the web is an example of Arnol’d diffusion, which is named after the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnol’d. Normally we associate diffusion with a random process in which, for example, the molecules of a gas move slowly from one region to another by countless collisions with other molecules. The presence of diffusion in such simple deterministic systems has many practical consequences such as providing a means for heating a gas of electrically charged particles (a plasma) in a magnetic field using electromagnetic waves.
These stochastic webs contain circular chains of islands, or beads on a necklace, if you prefer a different analogy, whose interiors contain periodic orbits. Surrounding the islands is a stochastic sea in which the orbits are chaotic and connected to all other points in the sea. You will also note that the Lyapunov exponents are small. Since the orbits diffuse slowly in the sea, nearby orbits remain close together for many iterations. For a similar reason, the calculated fractal dimension is lower than it should be. Recall that the dimension calculation is based on the previous 500 iterates, whose values tend to be nearly equal in this case.
Examples of stochastic webs produced by PROG26 are shown in Figures 7-33 through 7-40. Because of the slow diffusion of the orbit, these cases provide a good opportunity to exhibit the time variation with colors as shown in Plates 31 and 32. You may want to try different values of NMAX% in line 1050 to control the rate at which the colors change. Web maps provide a perfect illustration of how chaos and determinism coexist. The underlying symmetry of the equations is evident in the figures, but the orbit exhibits apparently random motion within the chaotic region.</code></pre>

<pre><code>All the previous examples of maps and differential equations in this book share the property that the right-hand sides of the equations are independent of the iteration number (N) or time (t). Such equations are called autonomous. For a given set of initial conditions, they produce the same solution for whatever time or iteration number they are started.
Some important physical processes are most conveniently expressed by nonautonomous equations. An example is a driven (forced), damped, linear, harmonic oscillator, which is described by the following equations:

X’ = Y
Y’ = -X - bY + A sin wt             (Equation 7I)</code></pre>
<p>In Equation 7I, b is the damping constant (friction), A is the amplitude of the drive (forcing) function, and  is the angular frequency (radians per second) of the drive. The friction force is assumed to be proportional and opposite to the velocity (-Y), although other forms give qualitatively similar results. This type of friction is called linear damping.
The usual trick for dealing with nonautonomous equations is to introduce an additional variable (say Z) and rewrite Equation 7I, for example, as</p>
<pre><code>X’ = Y
Y’ = -X - bY + A sin Z
Z’ = w                          (Equation 7J)</code></pre>
<p>Equation 7J contains a nonlinearity (sin Z), but it does not have chaotic solutions. The solution (for positive b) is a limit cycle with frequency . The limit cycle is largest when the damping is small (b positive but much less than 1) and  is 1, corresponding to resonance.
To obtain interesting chaotic solutions, we need additional nonlinear terms. We will restrict these nonlinearities to odd polynomials (X, X3, X2Y, and so forth) in the Y’ equation to preserve the symmetry of the oscillation. A general form with odd polynomials up to third order is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>X’ = a1Y
Y’ = a2X + a3X3 + a4X2Y + a5XY2 + a6Y + a7Y3 + a8sin Z
Z’ = a9 + 1.3                       (Equation 7K)</code></pre>
<p>If the product a1a2 is negative, these equations represent the motion of a mass oscillating on a nonlinear spring or a pendulum swinging through a large angle (but not going over the top). If a3/a2 is positive, the spring gets stiffer when stretched or compressed (hard spring). If a3/a2 is negative, the spring gets weaker when stretched or compressed (soft spring). If a3/a2 is -1/6, the solution approximates a vigorously swinging pendulum. If the product a1a2 is positive and a3/a2 is negative, the system models a buckled beam and is called the Duffing two-well oscillator. The final combination (a1a2 and a3/a2 both positive) is unstable and has an unbounded solution.
In Equation 7K, we can exploit the fact that Z enters only through the term sin Z; thus it is periodic with period 2. Whenever Z exceeds 2, we can subtract 2 from it without changing the result. This trick keeps Z bounded in the range 0 to 2 rather than letting it march off to infinity as it would otherwise do. The Z-coordinate then becomes the phase angle of the drive function. Note that the MOD function in most versions of BASIC works correctly only on integer variables, so it should not be used for the above purpose. The +1.3 term in the Z equation ensures that the phase angle always increases in time for -1.2 ≤ a9 ≤ 1.2. The fourth variable (W) is proportional to time as in the previous examples.

You can see several cycles of stretching and folding. Note that there are three diagonal bands that run from the lower left to the upper right of the attractor. The three bands are stretched and compressed into a single band, while two additional bands enter first from the upper left and then from the lower right. Thus one of the three bands consists of three smaller bands, one of which consists of three even smaller bands, and so forth. Such an infinitely layered band is called a thick line or a Cantor one-manifold. Viewed in three dimensions, the thick line would appear as a thick surface or a Cantor two-manifold.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> How Common is Chaos?</h2>
<pre><code>For hundreds of years, scientists have used equations like those in the previous chapters to describe nature. It is remarkable that almost no one recognized the chaotic solutions to those equations until the last few decades of the 20th century. Now researchers in many disciplines are beginning to see chaos under every rock. It is reasonable to wonder whether chaos is the rule or the exception.
Suppose we had a system of equations of sufficient complexity and with sufficiently many coefficients that it could be used to model most natural processes. We could then attempt to quantify the occurrence of chaos in these equations and draw an inference about the occurrence of chaos in nature. The equations in the previous chapters, especially those involving polynomials of high dimension and high order, might approximate such a system.
As a simple but very unrealistic example, suppose that all of nature could be modeled by the logistic equation (Equation 1C). This equation has a single parameter R that controls the character of the solution. If R is greater than 4 or less than -2, the solutions are unbounded, which means that this equation cannot model a physical process under those conditions. Essentially all physical processes are bounded, except perhaps the trajectory of a spacecraft launched with sufficient velocity to escape the galaxy. In the physically realistic range of R, there is a band of chaos between about 3.5 and 4, as shown in Figure 1-2 and another identical band between about -1.5 and -2. Careful analysis shows that chaos occurs over about 13% of the range of R from -2 to 4.
Since the logistic equation is too simple a model for almost everything, we should examine more complicated models. The Hénon map (Equation 3A) is a two-dimensional generalization of the logistic map. It has two control parameters, which normally are a = -1.4 and b = 0.3. With b = 0, the Hénon map reduces to the logistic map.
As with the logistic map, the Hénon map has unbounded solutions, chaotic solutions, and bounded nonchaotic solutions, depending on the values of a and b. The bounded nonchaotic solutions may be either fixed points or  periodic limit cycles. Figure 8-1 shows a region of the ab plane with the four classes of solutions indicated by different shades of gray. The bounded solutions constitute an island in the ab plane. On the northwest shore of this island is a chaotic beach, which occupies about 6% of the area of the island. The chaotic beach has many small embedded periodic ponds. The boundary between the chaotic and the periodic regions is itself a fractal.</code></pre>
<p>Figure 8-1. Regions of solutions for the Hénon map in the ab plane</p>
<pre><code>The logistic map is chaotic over 13% of its bounded range, and the Hénon map is chaotic over 6% of its bounded range. This result is counterintuitive because it suggests that more complicated (two-dimensional) systems are in some sense less chaotic than simpler (one-dimensional) systems. Is this a general result, or is it peculiar to these two maps? One way to decide is to examine a wider selection of equations, such as the ones used to produce the attractors exhibited throughout this book.
In collecting attractors, we have been discarding interesting information—the number of bounded nonchaotic solutions for each chaotic case that the program finds. Discarding data is offensive to scientists, since experiments are often performed with great effort and at considerable expense. The annals of science are ripe with examples of important discoveries that could have been made sooner or by others if only the right data had been recorded and analyzed.
Table 8-1 shows the results from 30,000 chaotic cases (1000 for each of the 30 types) as identified by the program. This table includes over 400 million cases, of which about 1 million are bounded. Of all the bounded solutions, 2.8% were chaotic according to the criterion described in Section 2.4. The polynomial maps all exhibit a similar occurrence of chaotic solutions. The same is true of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but the percentage is smaller. The reason for this behavior is not understood.</code></pre>

<pre><code>These results should not be taken too literally because the coefficients have been limited to the range -1.2 to 1.2, the ODEs have not been solved very accurately, and many cases are ambiguous. Chaotic solutions tend to occur at large values of the coefficients where most of the solutions are unbounded. A more careful evaluation, which corrects these difficulties and includes about 35,000 strange attractors but limited to fewer types, shows that the probability that a bounded solution is chaotic for an iterated polynomial map of dimension D and order O is given approximately by

P = 0.349 D-1.69 O-0.28                     (Equation 8A)</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the probability that a bounded solution is chaotic for a polynomial ODE of dimension D and order O is given approximately by</p>
<pre><code>P = 0.0003 D2 O0.5                      (Equation 8B)</code></pre>
<p>Maps appear to become less chaotic as they become more complicated (larger D and O), whereas ODEs become more chaotic.
To assess how common chaos is in nature, we must address the more complicated and subjective issue of whether the equations we have examined are a representative sample of the equations that describe natural processes. Furthermore, we cannot assume a priori that nature selects the coefficients of the equations uniformly over the bounded region of control space. It is possible that other constraints mitigate either against or in favor of chaotic behavior.
Another interesting question is how the fractal dimension and the Lyapunov exponent vary with the dimension and order of the system. Table 8-1 includes the average values of these quantities plus or minus (±) the standard deviation for each type of chaotic system. For polynomial maps and ODEs, the fractal dimension varies approximately as the square root of the system dimension. For polynomial maps, the Lyapunov exponent varies inversely with the system dimension. For polynomial ODEs, the Lyapunov exponent increases with the system dimension. The Lyapunov exponent appears to be independent of order for maps, but there is a tendency for the Lyapunov exponent of ODEs to increase with order.
These results are summarized in Figures 8-2 and 8-3. Figure 8-2 shows the relative probability that a strange attractor from a polynomial map or ODE will have a fractal dimension F plotted versus F/D0.5. The curve is sharply peaked at a value of about 0.8. Almost no attractors have a fractal dimension greater than about 1.3D0.5. The Lorenz and Rössler attractors (with fractal dimensions slightly above 2.0 in a three-dimensional space) are close to this maximum value. Figure 8-3 shows the relative probability that a strange attractor from a polynomial map will have a Lyapunov exponent L plotted versus LD. This curve shows a much broader peak at about 0.5. These results hold when the calculations are done more carefully. The reason for this behavior is not understood, but it is potentially important because it gives an indication of the complexity of the system of equations responsible for a strange attractor that one observes in nature.</p>
<p>Figure 8-2. Probability distribution of fractal dimension</p>
<p>Figure 8-3. Probability distribution of Lyapunov exponent</p>
<pre><code>The similarity of the fractal dimension for attractors produced by polynomials of the same dimensionality raises the concern that they might in some sense all be the same attractor, viewed from different angles and distorted in various ways. There may be a simple mapping that converts one attractor into the others. In such a case, a statistical analysis of the collection would be misleading and meaningless. However, since the Lyapunov exponents are spread over a broad range, it seems likely that the attractors are distinct. In any case, they are visually very different, and thus the technique has artistic if not scientific value.
It is interesting to ask whether the above results are peculiar to polynomials. Table 8-1 includes data for the special functions that were described in Chapter 7. Some of these cases tend to be more chaotic than the polynomials, but the differences are not enormous. Thus is would appear, insofar as nature can be represented by systems of equations of the type described in this book, that chaos is not the most common behavior, but neither is it particularly rare.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.9</span> But Is It Art?</h2>
<pre><code>A very different question is whether pictures generated by solving deterministic equations with a computer can legitimately qualify as art. Some people would say that if it was done by a computer without human intervention, it cannot be art. On the other hand, humans chose the equations, built and programmed the computer, decided how the solution would be displayed, and selected from the large number of cases that the computer generated. In this view, the computer is just another tool in the hands of the artist.
At the core of the issue is what we mean by art. There are at least two, not necessarily mutually incompatible, views. One is that art is the expression of ideas and emotions—a form of communication between the artist and the observer. The other emphasizes formal design, in which the viewer admires the skill with which the artist manipulated the materials, without reading any particular meaning into it.
Strange attractors qualify by either definition. They are expressions of ideas embodied in the equations, whether it be the dynamics of population growth or a swinging pendulum. These ideas are often abstract and are most apparent to the trained mathematician or scientist, but anyone can see in the patterns the surreal images of plants, animals, clouds, and swirling fluids. The appearance of such familiar images in the solutions of mathematical equations is probably more than coincidental.
Strange attractors also necessarily embody concepts of design. The interplay of determinism and unpredictability ensures that they are neither formless nor excessively repetitious. Furthermore, the skills of an artisan (if not an artist) are required to translate the abstract equations into aesthetically desirable visual forms. These skills are different from (but not inferior to) those possessed by more conventional artists. Renaissance artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, were often also scientists. We may now be entering a new Renaissance in which art and science are again being drawn together through the visual images produced by computers.
Some artists view art as a creative process whose primary goal is to provide the artist with a sense of satisfaction. The resulting work is merely an inevitable by-product. This view seems especially appropriate for the production of strange attractors, where the programmer’s satisfaction is derived from causing the computer to generate the patterns, even if they are never seen by anyone else. Indeed, the computer offers the ideal medium for such conceptual artists, since there need be no material product whatsoever.
Note that visual art need not be beautiful to be good, just as a play need not be humorous. It may be intellectually or emotionally satisfying, or even disturbing. It should capture and hold the interest of the viewer, however. The span of the viewer’s attention is one measure of its quality. Art may mix the familiar and the unfamiliar to produce both comfort and dissonance. Furthermore, beauty is at least partially in the eye of the beholder, although recent research indicates that there are absolute universal measures of beauty that form very early in life and may even be genetic.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.10</span> Can Computers Critique Art?</h2>
<pre><code>The idea that a computer can make aesthetic judgments seems absurd and even offensive to many people. Yet the program developed in this book is already doing this to some degree. For every object (strange attractor) that it identifies, it has discarded many dozens as being uninteresting (nonchaotic). Perhaps the computer could be programmed to be even more discriminating and to select those strange attractors that are likely to appeal to humans. To the extent that aesthetic judgment involves objective as well as subjective criteria, such a proposition is not unreasonable.
A computer lacks emotion, but it can be taught in much the same way that people can be taught. With the help of a human to point out which attractors are visually interesting, the computer can correlate human opinion with various quantitative measures of the attractor. It can then test each new case and assign a probability that it would appeal to a human.
One of the reasons we have been calculating and saving the fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent for each strange attractor is in anticipation of developing such criteria. You can think of the dimension as a measure of the strangeness of an attractor and the Lyapunov exponent as a measure of its chaoticity. These are just two of infinitely many independent quantities we can use to describe each attractor. If we find encouragement from them, it suggests that more can be done.
The first step is to search for a relation between the aesthetic quality and the fractal dimension or Lyapunov exponent. For this purpose, 7500 strange attractors from two-dimensional quadratic maps were evaluated by the author and seven volunteers, including two graduate art students, a former art history major, three physics graduate students, and a former mathematics major. All evaluators were born and raised in the United States. The evaluations were done by choosing attractors randomly and displaying them sequentially on the computer screen without any indication of the quantities that characterize them. The volunteers were asked to evaluate each case on a scale of one to five according to its aesthetic appeal. It only took a few seconds for each evaluation.
Figure 8-4 displays a summary of all the evaluations as a function of fractal dimension (F) and Lyapunov exponent (L), using a gray scale in which the darker regions are the most highly rated. The cases examined by particular individuals show a similar trend. All evaluators tended to prefer attractors with dimensions between about 1.1 and 1.5 and Lyapunov exponents between zero and about 0.3. Some of the most interesting cases have Lyapunov exponents below about 0.1. You saw many such examples earlier in this book.</code></pre>
<p>Figure 8-4. Regions of highest aesthetic quality in the FL plane</p>
<pre><code>The dimension preference is not surprising, since many natural objects have dimensions in this range. Nature is strange, but usually not totally bizarre. Some of the attractors that are most universally liked resemble well-known and easily recognizable objects. You can find many such examples in this book.
The Lyapunov exponent preference is harder to understand, but it suggests that strongly chaotic systems are too unpredictable to be appealing. For the 443 cases that were rated 5 (best) by the evaluators, the average dimension was F = 1.30 ± 0.20, and the average Lyapunov exponent was L = 0.21 ± 0.13 bits per iterations, where the errors represent plus or minus one standard deviation. About 28% of the cases evaluated fall within both error bars. Thus this simple criterion would allow the computer to discard nearly three-quarters of the cases that are least likely to be visually appealing. This technique works in practice and was used in some cases to help select attractors to display in this book.</code></pre>

<div id="whats-left-to-do" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.11</span> What’s Left to Do?</h2>
<pre><code>This book has described a new technique for generating strange attractors in unlimited numbers. A large collection of such objects offers many interesting possibilities to the artist and scientist alike. Some of these uses have already been mentioned. Others may have occurred to you as you read this book. This section leaves you with a few additional suggestions of things you might want to explore on your own.
If your main interest is art, you probably want to produce attractors with improved spatial resolution and more colors. You can experiment with printing on different types of paper or other media. The simple linear correspondence of X, Y, Z, and W to position or color is not essential. Other mappings between the mathematical variables and the points displayed on the screen are possible. You have already seen how to project the attractors onto a sphere. You can project them onto other objects such as cylinders, tori, or even other strange attractors.
When you have generated an attractor that appeals to you, it is natural to want to make small changes to make it even better. The coefficients in the equations are controls that you can adjust. Like knobs on your television set, they allow you to tune the attractor to get just what you want. You can change the colors without replotting the data using the PALETTE command in BASIC. You also can rotate the image to find the best angle from which to view it.
You can produce animated strange attractors with a video camera viewing a monitor connected to the camera, or even more simply, with a photodiode connected to an oscilloscope whose screen illuminates the photodiode. This video-feedback technique has much in common with iterated maps. Each illuminated dot on the screen is mapped back to a different location after a delay determined by the propagation of the electrical and optical signals. The main control parameters are the distance, rotation, focusing, intensity, color, and hue. Some settings produce unbounded solutions—the screen goes solid black or solid white. Other settings produce a fixed-point solution with a stationary pattern. Under other conditions, periodic behavior occurs. The most interesting situation occurs when the pattern constantly changes but is not periodic, corresponding to a chaotic strange attractor. Sometimes you can perturb the system with a flash of light or by moving your hand across the field of view, causing the system to switch from one attractor to another.
Some of the most interesting examples of computer fractals come from plotting the basin boundaries of various attractors. The basin is the set of all initial conditions that are drawn to the attractor. Sometimes these boundaries are smooth; other times they are fractals. By coloring the points just outside the basin according to the number of iterations required for them to leave some (usually large) region surrounding the attractor, beautiful escape-time fractal patterns can be produced.
All of our attractors have such basins, and it’s not hard to program the computer to display them, but the calculations are very slow. As an example, Figure 8-5 shows in black the basin for the Hénon map. It is relatively smooth and not particularly interesting. It resembles a thick version of the attractor, but rotated by 90 degrees. Figure 8-6 shows the basin of another two-dimensional quadratic map called the Tinkerbell map. Its boundary has obvious fractal structure. In each case, the basin boundary appears to touch the attractor, suggesting that this surprising feature may be common.</code></pre>
<p>Figure 8-5. Basin of attraction for the Hénon map</p>
<p>Figure 8-6. Basin of attraction for the Tinkerbell map</p>
<pre><code>Notice that we have now plotted the Hénon map in three different spaces. Figure 3-1 is the usual plot of the orbit in the space of the dynamical variables X and Y. Figure 8-1 is a plot in the space of the control parameters a and b. Figure 8-5 is a plot in the space of the initial conditions X0 and Y0. All of these plots are necessary to characterize the attractor completely.
The well-known and much-studied Mandelbrot set is the set of bounded solutions in the ab plane of the mapping

Xn+1 = Xn2 - Yn2 + a
Yn+1 = 2XnYn + b                    (Equation 8C)</code></pre>
<p>The variables X and Y usually are thought of as the real and imaginary parts of a complex number Z. Each point in the ab plane has associated with it a Julia set, which is the set of all initial conditions X0 and Y0 whose solutions are bounded. The Mandelbrot set is the set of Julia sets every point of which is connected to every other point. The Julia set is named after Gaston Julia, a French mathematician who, along with Pierre Fatou, studied iterated maps in the complex plane at about the time of the first world war. Combinations of a and b at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set produce chaotic solutions, but values inside the set lead to fixed points or limit cycles. For b = 0 and Y0 = 0 (the real axis), Equation 8C reduces to a simple one-dimensional quadratic map equivalent to the logistic map.
The Mandelbrot set has been described as the most complicated mathematical object ever seen. It may also be the ultimate computer virus, in that it takes over not only the machine (because of the large computational requirements) but also the mind of the programmer, who often becomes addicted to the beauty and variety of the patterns that it produces.
Like the Mandelbrot set, most of the attractors produced by the programs in this book have intricate structure near the basin boundaries. You can zoom in on these regions to produce patterns that rival those produced by the Mandelbrot set. Calculation times increase markedly as you zoom in ever more closely, however.
Much more can be done to correlate the aesthetic appeal of the attractors with the various numerical quantities that characterize them. Besides the fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent, the system that produced them has dimension and order. Other measures of an attractor’s dimension include the capacity dimension, the information dimension, and the Lyapunov dimension. Related to the Lyapunov exponent is the entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of the system. As with the dimension, the entropy can be defined in many ways. These quantities and others are described in many of the books on fractals in the bibliography. Maps and differential equations can also be compared.
You can test for differences between the aesthetic preferences of artists and scientists. Preliminary indications suggest that complexity might appeal more to artists than to scientists, who tend to see beauty in simplicity. There may also be discernible cultural differences. You can see how the various display techniques alter one’s preferences. For example, the use of color seems to increase the tolerance for attractors of high fractal dimension.
Many scientific studies can be performed on a sufficiently large collection of strange attractors. The results of Table 8-1, which are merely suggestive and limited to particular types of equations, can be refined with more cases and more examples of each case. For low dimensions, maps are more chaotic than the equivalent ODEs. As the system dimension increases, however, maps become less chaotic, while ODEs become more chaotic. Equation 8A and 8B suggest that for a system dimension of about six, maps and ODEs will be equally chaotic. Will their roles reverse at higher dimension, or will the chaotic fractions asymptotically approach a universal value of about 2%?
You can ask the same type of questions about bounded, nonchaotic solutions (fixed points, limit cycles, and tori). It is especially interesting to see how common 3-tori are in light of Peixoto’s theorem (see Section 6.6), but their production probably requires system dimensions of about 10 according to Figure 8-2, which may or may not apply to tori. Almost nothing is known about such issues.
We have considered the fraction of the bounded, hyperdimensional control space over which chaos occurs. It is also interesting to examine the shape, location, and dimension of this chaotic region, as we did for the two-parameter Hénon map in Figure 8-1. It is likely that this region is a fractal. How does its fractal dimension depend on the system dimension and other characteristics of the system of equations? It appears that the dimension of the chaotic region is about half the dimension of the control space for the cases in this book.
The scaling of the average fractal dimension and the Lyapunov exponent with the system dimension is intriguing and should be studied with more cases, better statistics, and more accurate calculations of the fractal dimension. You can examine statistically how the various measures of dimension compare and how these dimensions are related to the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents.
You can look for relations between the geometrical properties of attractors and their respective power spectra. The technique can be used to explore and to quantify the various routes by which a stable solution becomes chaotic. Many such routes have been identified, such as the period-doubling exhibited by the logistic equation, but there are probably others yet to be discovered. Your role resembles that of a biologist confronted with a large variety of species, trying to classify, quantify, and study their similarities, differences, and patterns of behavior.
Another interesting study is to search for previously unknown simple examples of chaos. Variations of the logistic equation are the simplest chaotic polynomial maps. The Lorenz and Rössler attractors are often cited as the simplest examples of chaotic polynomial ODEs. The Lorenz equations (Equation 6D) have seven terms and two quadratic nonlinearities, and the Rössler equations (Equation 6E) have seven terms and one quadratic nonlinearity.
There are at least five different systems of chaotic, three-dimensional quadratic ODEs with five terms and two nonlinearities, and six systems with six terms and one nonlinearity. It will be left as a challenge for you to find them. There does not seem to be any chaotic system of quadratic ODEs with as few as four terms. To whet your appetite, here’s a simple chaotic system resembling the Lorenz attractor that has two fewer terms and all its coefficients equal to one:</p>
<pre><code>X&#39; = YZ
Y&#39; = X -Y
Z&#39; = 1 - XY             (Equation 8D)</code></pre>
<p>You can examine this case using the code QM7NM3NM3LM4NM2LM6.
Here’s another case with five terms and all unity coefficients that’s volume-preserving and thus does not have an attractor, but its solution is either a 2-torus or chaotic depending upon the initial conditions:</p>
<pre><code>X&#39; = Y
Y&#39; = X + YZ
Z&quot; = 1 - Y2                 (Equation 8E)</code></pre>
<p>It can be produced with the code QM5NM5LM5NM2NM5LM3.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.12</span> What Good Is It?</h2>
<pre><code>It is rare that a mathematical concept captivates the interest not only of scientists in diverse fields but of the general public. Chaos has done this, and it has been heralded by some as the next great revolution in science. It has ushered in a new field of experimental mathematics, sometimes pejoratively called recreational mathematics by the more traditional and often cynical older breed of mathematicians. The use of computers to produce exotic visual patterns has made difficult mathematical ideas accessible to those without extensive formal training.
Yet it is fair to ask what it has done other than to make pretty pictures. One response is to claim that the same things were probably said about the discovery of the atomic nucleus, or electricity, or fire. We must have faith that intellectual advances will eventually yield useful applications.
At the deepest level, an understanding of chaos alters our view of the world. Having seen the complexity that can arise from simple equations, we have reason to hope that simple equations may suffice to describe much of the complexity of the world. Difficult and long-standing problems such as fluid turbulence may eventually be understood using the ideas of chaos. Turbulence is difficult because it involves both temporal and spatial chaos and because its dimension is high. Chaos may also provide tools for making better predictions of complicated and apparently random systems, such as the weather, the stock market, earthquakes, epidemics, and population growth. It may also have applications in communications and in cryptography for devising secure codes and breaking them.
Since chaotic systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, you might conclude that prediction is hopeless, but this is not the case. Prediction is hopeless for a random system or for an extremely complicated deterministic system. As the physicist Neils Bohr remarked, “Prediction is difficult, especially of the future.”  However, if the system is simple and chaotic, then the determinism can be exploited to improve short-term predictions.
Furthermore, if the equations produce a strange attractor, as most chaotic systems do, we know that the solution lies somewhere on the attractor. Remember that an attractor occupies a negligible volume of the space in which it is embedded. Although we can’t predict where on the attractor the system will be at any particular time in the distant future, we can exclude the vast number of possible states that lie off the attractor. In meteorological terms, this might lead to eliminating the possibility of certain weather conditions with near absolute certainty.
When we see a system in nature that behaves erratically, we are now led to wonder whether it is an example of chaos. Is simple determinism hidden in seemingly random data? This problem is opposite to the one addressed in this book. Here we have started with simple equations and produced complicated patterns. Nature presents us with complicated patterns that may or may not come from simple equations.
Often we are given only a single fluctuating quantity sampled at discrete times—a so-called time series. The average daily temperature in New York and the daily closing Dow Jones Industrial Average are two examples of a time series. Sometimes a complicated-looking time series is simply a sum of several sine waves of different unrelated frequencies. In such a case, accurate predictions are possible using linear methods. A good example is the tides, whose behavior is not simply periodic but nevertheless can be predicted with considerable accuracy because it is governed by periodic notions of the earth and moon. More often, the time series has no such simple representation. In such a case, we would like to determine whether the behavior is random or chaotic. Chaotic systems often produce strange attractors.
We usually don’t have data for all the variables that describe the system, nor do we even know how many there are, so we don’t know the dimension of the space in which an attractor might be embedded. Furthermore, the data record is likely to be corrupted by random noise and measurement errors. The number of data points may be small, and the system may not have reached a steady state. Finally, we usually don’t have control over the system, so we cannot directly test its sensitivity to initial conditions.
Such a situation sounds hopeless, but progress has recently been made in testing for chaos in natural systems. For example, one can plot each data point versus its predecessor, as we did with the one-dimensional maps in Chapter 2. In some cases, this procedure is enough to reveal the determinism. More often, it is necessary to plot each data point versus several of its predecessors in a high-dimensional space. If the system is described by a strange attractor, the result is a version of the attractor called a diffeomorphism that is distorted but has the same fractal dimension. Similarly, the Lyapunov exponent can be estimated by selecting nearby points in this space and determining how rapidly they diverge from one another.
The fractal dimension is important because the number of variables and equations is at least as large as the next higher integer, since the attractor has to be embedded in a space with dimension higher than its fractal dimension. These equations are not unique, however. Extracting equations from the data is a difficult if not impossible task, but one whose rewards justify the effort. The equations provide insight into the underlying dynamics and a means for making predictions.
Perhaps the ultimate test for chaos is the accuracy of short-term predictions. With truly random data, prediction is impossible. Conversely, with chaotic data, there is absolute determinism, and prediction is possible in principle, at least on short-time scales dictated by the Lyapunov exponent and the precision of the data. Predictability thus precludes complete randomness and signifies determinism, although randomness and determinism often coexist. For example, the business cycle is mostly random but includes deterministic seasonal changes. The deterministic part is not necessarily chaotic, however.
Dynamical systems are everywhere. Your body contains several. Your heart is a dynamical system whose solution normally approaches a limit cycle, but which can become chaotic when in fibrillation or a fixed point upon death. Recent research suggests that even a healthy heart beats chaotically, and a nearly periodic pattern sometimes precedes cardiac arrest.
Other oscillations occur in your lungs, brain, and muscles. Electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms are time-series records used by doctors to deduce information about the dynamics of the corresponding organ. Some chaos in the brain may be necessary for creativity because it prevents us from repeatedly approaching the same problems in the same way. The fractal dimension of electroencephalograms has been observed to increase when a subject is engaged in mental activity. In psychology, manic depression resembles a limit cycle, and certain types of erratic behavior might be strange attractors.
Evidence for low-dimensional strange attractors has been found in systems as diverse as the weather and climate, the business cycle, childhood epidemics, sunspots, plasma fluctuations, and even in computer models of the arms race. Some of these results should be viewed skeptically because there are many ways to be misled. The number of data points needed for an accurate determination of the dimension has been variously estimated from a pessimistic and probably overly conservative 42F to a more optimistic but still large 102 + 0.4F. If the interval between data points is too small, a fictitiously low dimension can result. Certain types of colored noise (also called fractional Brownian motion) have a degree of determinism and produce time-series records with an apparently low dimension. Many tests have been devised, such as comparing the results with those from a surrogate data set obtained by randomly shuffling the numbers in the time series.
Chaos has a deep philosophical significance. If determinism implied perfect predictability, there would be no room for free will. We would be just small cogs in a large machine over which we have no control. It’s easy to feel insignificant in a vast and complicated universe dominated by forces too powerful to resist.
However, chaos illustrates that determinism does not imply predictability. What is bad news for those who want to predict the weather or the stock market is good news for those who want to control them. Recall the hypothetical butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil, which sets off tornadoes in Texas. If the world is really governed by deterministic chaos, we are drastically changing the future with everything we do. We need never feel unimportant or insignificant. Who would have thought that a concept from mathematics could give meaning and purpose to our lives?</code></pre>
